bitching about brake trouble.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.078
Thanks, Molly. You're a superstar.

Pat had to ease off.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.000
We've dropped down to seventh.

If you can just hold position overnight,
hopeful sunrise catches us a break.

02:24.319 --> 02:28.039
Sonny, watch that high-speed balance.
High-speed balance.

Sonny Hayes back in the Porsche

03:01.840 --> 03:03.279
We all know Hayes

03:03.280 --> 03:04.438
likes to light up the night,

03:04.439 --> 03:08.360
but with the BMW at the head of this pack,
he's got a massive job ahead of him.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.959
Right out of the gate,
Hayes threads the needle into turn three,

03:22.960 --> 03:24.038
moving up to fourth place.

03:24.039 --> 03:26.158
Sonny, wanna maybe pass on the straights?

03:26.159 --> 03:27.439
Just let me drive, will ya?

03:29.680 --> 03:30.839
(song continues)

03:30.840 --> 03:33.439
(commentator) Look out.
Engine trouble for the number 12.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.960
That moves Hayes up another spot.

You've been coolin'
Baby, I've been droolin'

03:53.840 --> 03:55.719
Sweet baby Jesus. We got ten more hours.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.079
Just let Sonny do his thing.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.519
And if these first few laps
are any indication,

04:00.520 --> 04:03.918
it appears as though Sonny Hayes
may have left his brake pedal at home.

Every inch of my love

Can Hayes hang on?

04:57.519 --> 04:58.479
And he does.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.839
Goddamn!

05:00.480 --> 05:02.359
See that? That's how you race, boys.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.278

you need to do the same goddamn thing.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.319

Now, it's up to Cale Kelso
to hang on to that lead.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.160
(Kelso) Thanks for the head start, Chief.

05:23.319 --> 05:25.759
Hey. Lose that lead, I'll kill ya.

Don't you even want to touch it?

06:17.600 --> 06:18.518
- Ooh, bad luck.
- Come on.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.439
- Just touch it.
- (laughing) No. Hey.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.480
I will take that bonus check though.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.720
Sonny. Sonny! Just hear me out.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.838
Look, I wanna bring you on board.

- You're CHR family now.

06:32.279 --> 06:34.078
Right here, next year, let's run it back.

06:34.079 --> 06:35.958
We did it, man. Deal's a deal.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.120
I-I know what a deal is.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.278
So that's it? One and done?

06:41.279 --> 06:43.838
I appreciate the seat, Chip. I really do.

06:43.839 --> 06:45.360
What kind of way is that to race?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.679
You just spend your whole life
starting over, man.

06:47.680 --> 06:48.720
You take care.

- How many races left?
- Nine.

All right. Let's say I'm the next Louis...

10:00.000 --> 10:01.840
- Chiron. Mm-hmm.
- Him.

10:02.799 --> 10:05.279
The problem is it's not just the driver,
it's the car.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.439

what he's smiling about.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.480
Come on.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.559
He's smiling at the possibility.

10:47.399 --> 10:48.840

10:50.600 --> 10:51.559
Yep.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.559
Okay.

- Oh, my God.

10:57.519 --> 10:58.758
First class.

an open seat in Formula 1.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.999
(sighs) Well, how much are we talking?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.399
Not about the money.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.360

13:50.480 --> 13:52.399
Locked it up. Flat spot, front left.

13:57.919 --> 13:59.480
(sighs)

14:00.399 --> 14:01.439
Bring him in.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.839
Go to strat one.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.600
Uh, box this lap. Box this lap.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.120
- (groans)
- Let's go find those gremlins.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.240
(blows)

14:41.200 --> 14:43.600
(crew chattering)

14:45.159 --> 14:46.559
(groans)

14:53.399 --> 14:54.758
(grunts, gasps)

14:54.759 --> 14:56.039
Sorry, Joshua.

14:58.879 --> 15:00.879
Jodie, try not to kill our driver.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.158
What's the verdict? (sniffs)

15:09.159 --> 15:12.679
(sighs) I don't know what's happening.
I mean, it feels good. I start to push.

15:13.159 --> 15:15.439
Then it understeers in the slow corners
and oversteers the fast.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.999
What? On entries or exits?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.638
Either. Both.

15:18.639 --> 15:19.959
Oh, great. Yeah.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.719
There's 10,000 sensors on this thing
and you can't tell me what's going on.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.518
But I'm not out there, am I?

15:24.519 --> 15:27.399
So, I-I'm gonna need
your help on this. Please.

15:31.759 --> 15:34.399
(speaking German)

15:35.240 --> 15:36.440
(speaking German)

15:41.440 --> 15:43.278
(child giggles)

15:43.279 --> 15:45.840
(in English)
150 million dollar jungle gym.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.399
So cute.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.799
We should let her drive.
Can't be any worse.

15:51.519 --> 15:53.120
(child imitating engine)

15:53.759 --> 15:55.038
Joshua.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.278
- Hi.
- Lisbeth. PR?

15:57.279 --> 15:58.959
- Oh, yeah.
- Doesn't matter.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.558
For the press conference,
we want to steer around tech issues

16:01.559 --> 16:04.959
and focus on the super strong bond
with your new teammate, Luca Cortez.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.719
(laughs) Luca?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.159
Who I've known a week.

16:08.679 --> 16:10.719
Who when he was third banana
on the left at Red Bull,

16:10.720 --> 16:13.200
told the press he thought
Joshua Pearce was overrated.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.558
That Luca Cortez?

16:15.559 --> 16:17.038
Yes.

16:17.039 --> 16:20.119
- (chuckles) Can't wait. Yeah.
- All right. Great. Thank you.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.158
- Yo.
- Yep.

16:21.159 --> 16:23.359
That's a yes? Yeah? Yes? (groans)

16:23.360 --> 16:24.398
(Joshua) What's up?

16:24.399 --> 16:26.039
Yo, you were right, bro.

16:26.559 --> 16:28.918
Ruben's in big trouble.
He might have to sell the team.

16:28.919 --> 16:30.758
- (snaps fingers)
- I knew it.

16:30.759 --> 16:31.959
And what does that mean for me?

16:31.960 --> 16:34.320
New buyers, they're likely to clean house.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.440
Listen.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.919
You need to show these people
who the number one driver really is, man.

16:41.519 --> 16:42.480
Now.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.320
Or you're gonna lose your job.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.398
Yeah. Let that sink in.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.639
(speaking German)

16:51.399 --> 16:53.480
- (in English) Hey.
- (parent, speaking German)

16:54.639 --> 16:55.919
You good?

16:58.159 --> 17:02.239
Okay, let's take
the first half of the season

17:02.240 --> 17:04.239
and erase it from our minds.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.278
(crew cheers)

17:05.279 --> 17:07.519
Someone says,
"Kaspar, what happened this year?"

17:08.039 --> 17:11.919
I swear on the lives of my children,
I do not freaking know.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.278
(laughs)

17:13.279 --> 17:14.559
There's only this car.

17:15.119 --> 17:18.639
And there is only our future.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.400
(crew exclaiming) Yes. Our future.

17:30.039 --> 17:31.558
(Kaspar) Who is that asshole?

17:31.559 --> 17:32.599
He's with me.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.159
Your man thought I was maintenance.
Sent me to the back gate.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.559
(Ruben chuckles)

17:38.559 --> 17:39.919
Brother, you have never let me down.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.999
- (chuckles) Well, there's still time.
- (chuckles)

17:42.000 --> 17:43.598
Apex GP!

17:43.599 --> 17:46.038
Sonny Hayes.
He raced with me back in the day.

17:46.039 --> 17:47.798
- Against you, you mean.
- Yeah.

17:47.799 --> 17:50.239
- Kate McKenna, our technical director.
- Hi.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.118
- Dodge Dauda, our chief mechanic.
- Hi.

17:53.119 --> 17:55.278
And Kaspar Smolinski, team principal.

17:55.279 --> 17:56.838
You may know him by reputation.

17:56.839 --> 17:59.559
Five-time Constructors champion
with Ferrari.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.359
Huh.

18:02.079 --> 18:03.199
As a rear jack man.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.838
So was my pop. Can't win without 'em.

18:04.839 --> 18:07.680
- And our talented rookie, Joshua.
- Why has he got a helmet?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.518
- Uh, safety?
- (chuckles)

18:10.519 --> 18:12.879
Joshua, your seat is safe. Okay?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.799
Sonny is here for the audition.

18:17.119 --> 18:18.479
When was the last time you won a race?

18:18.480 --> 18:20.118
Sunday. Daytona.

18:20.119 --> 18:22.038
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I meant Formula 1.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.278
Oh, I'm sorry. Then same as you.

18:24.279 --> 18:27.239
- (laughs, exclaims) Wow.
- (chuckles)

18:27.240 --> 18:29.919
Never thought I'd say this,
has anyone seen Luca Cortez?

18:29.920 --> 18:31.959
- (chuckles)
- Sidebar bitte , Ruben.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.879
When I interview with you,
many veteran drivers--

18:34.880 --> 18:36.479
Yeah, who all turned you down.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.038
- How many?
- Seven.

18:38.039 --> 18:39.798
- That's a lot.
- I'm number seven?

18:39.799 --> 18:41.239
- Mm-hmm.
- You're eight.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.518
This is a disaster.

18:42.519 --> 18:43.838
Starting to feel more like a nine.

18:43.839 --> 18:45.558
Technically, there is one
who I've not heard from yet.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.719
- (stammers)
- So I am a nine?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.318
You know how numbers work, right?

18:48.319 --> 18:51.199
In business,
my most inspired ideas come late.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.719
Yeah. Best things in life
usually arrive ninth, right?

18:53.720 --> 18:57.078
With respect, Ruben, I cannot condone
we spend our only test day

18:57.079 --> 18:59.199
giving your long-lost teammate
an audition.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.558
Kaspar, you misunderstand.

19:00.559 --> 19:02.880
We're not auditioning him.
He's auditioning us.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.479
That's your new driver.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.599
Good luck.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.999
New wing, new side pods.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.440
Any changes to the floor?

19:13.559 --> 19:16.079
Nothing the eight other drivers
wouldn't have figured out.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.598
That's why they call me Lucky Number Nine.

19:18.599 --> 19:21.358
Listen, it's been a while
since you've driven here, mate. Yeah?

19:21.359 --> 19:23.599
The balance on these cars are tricky,
so be careful turn one and nine.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.400
Wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.118
How about we set a reasonable target?

19:28.119 --> 19:31.639
Give me the same setup as him. If I can't
post a lap time within a second of JP's,

19:31.640 --> 19:33.319
then I will promptly see myself out

19:33.960 --> 19:35.838
and you're free to take a shot
at lucky number ten.

19:35.839 --> 19:37.559
- Ten?
- Ten.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.200
Ten.

19:41.319 --> 19:42.359
Who's JP?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.119
(rock music playing)

19:46.200 --> 19:48.798
Cross round on Brooklands,
easy on Luffield.

19:48.799 --> 19:50.959
Up to Woodcote, hard out in Copse.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.279
And be careful on the curve.

19:56.839 --> 19:59.680
Default mode, settings one, to two,
back to three.

20:00.279 --> 20:01.959
Differential one through four.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.279
DRS.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.879
I bet you thought
You'd seen the last of me

20:10.880 --> 20:14.278
I can't change the way I am, you see

20:14.279 --> 20:16.118
I think it's my responsibility

20:16.119 --> 20:17.639
(exhales deeply)

20:17.640 --> 20:21.199
To tell you
I'm just as bad as I used to be

20:21.200 --> 20:23.038
(engine starts, revs)

20:23.039 --> 20:25.839
I'm just as bad as I used to be

20:26.839 --> 20:28.160
(breathes deeply)

20:29.359 --> 20:31.359
Okay. Let's see what you got.

20:38.359 --> 20:43.319
If he raced with Ruben,
he raced with Schumacher. With Senna.

20:45.599 --> 20:48.839
I tried changing my reality

20:49.440 --> 20:52.319
But I don't think
It's gonna set me free

20:53.279 --> 20:55.959
There's only one thing I can guarantee

20:55.960 --> 21:00.240
And that's
I'm just as bad as I used to be

21:01.000 --> 21:03.599
I'm just as bad as I used to be

21:04.279 --> 21:07.599
I'm just as bad as I used to be

21:08.079 --> 21:12.078
I'm just as bad as I used to be

21:12.079 --> 21:13.880
All right, pull up Joshua's sector times.

21:23.279 --> 21:24.919
Twenty quid says he stacks it.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.559
Make it a hundred, you're on.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.639
Oh, shit.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.758
- (laughs)
- (laughs)

21:30.759 --> 21:33.879
Sorry, uh, this is Hugh Nickleby,
your race engineer.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.879
Good morning, Hugh.
How are my tire temps looking?

21:35.880 --> 21:38.679
Yep, almost warm. End of the lap,
you should be good to push.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.160
(exhales deeply)

21:41.559 --> 21:42.519
(grunts)

21:43.559 --> 21:44.599
(exhales deeply)

21:47.759 --> 21:49.960
(tires squeal)

21:53.599 --> 21:55.518
(sighs)

21:55.519 --> 21:57.279
Right. Man.

21:58.279 --> 21:59.919
- (Sonny) Hugh?
- Yes, sir?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.879
- You should've taken that bet .
- (chuckles)

22:01.880 --> 22:03.240
- (sighs)
- (Hugh) Copy that.

22:03.839 --> 22:07.359
No one's accusing me of sanity

22:08.119 --> 22:11.559
I ain't everybody's cup of tea

22:12.200 --> 22:13.919
But that's the facts
I'm talkin' factually

22:13.920 --> 22:15.119
Going for a lap.

22:16.039 --> 22:18.358
I'm just as bad as I used to be

22:18.359 --> 22:22.639
Yes, I'm just as bad as I used to be

22:22.640 --> 22:26.400
Whoa, I'm just as bad as I used to be

22:26.960 --> 22:30.960
I'm just as bad as I used to be

22:32.000 --> 22:34.358
Nope. Shit.

22:34.359 --> 22:35.399
He's dead.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.078
Come on. Don't do that.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.719
(all groan)

22:39.720 --> 22:40.759
And buried.

23:16.359 --> 23:17.680
(grunts)

23:18.799 --> 23:19.839
Wait.

23:21.759 --> 23:23.079
Wait.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.200
(inhales sharply)

23:25.960 --> 23:27.318
Now.

23:27.319 --> 23:28.359
(grunts)

23:30.680 --> 23:31.920
The car is there, come on.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.598
He's gaining.

23:37.599 --> 23:38.839
Ah, shit.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.200
- (tires squealing)
- (grunts)

23:47.279 --> 23:49.798
(grunts, groans)

23:49.799 --> 23:50.838
(song ends)

23:50.839 --> 23:52.598
- (grunts)
- You okay?

23:52.599 --> 23:55.118
(groans) Yep. All good.

23:55.119 --> 23:58.598
- (laughs)
- (sirens wailing)

23:58.599 --> 24:01.200
(grunting)

24:07.119 --> 24:09.400
- (groans, sighs)
- (Kaspar) Oh!

24:10.119 --> 24:12.959
- (Kate) Come on.
- (Sonny pants)

24:12.960 --> 24:14.358
Yeah, she's got something.

24:14.359 --> 24:15.839
Yeah, you mean had something.

24:17.119 --> 24:19.318
But definitely snappy
in the high-speed corners.

24:19.319 --> 24:20.599
Unpredictable in the lows.

24:21.519 --> 24:23.518
Had trouble with the rears, turns 14, 16--

24:23.519 --> 24:25.038
And the final turn, maybe?

24:25.039 --> 24:27.240
- No, that's on me.
- What was his lap time?

24:27.880 --> 24:32.440
He passed his entirely self-imposed test
by five hundredths of a second.

24:34.839 --> 24:36.240
(sighs) Huh.

24:36.799 --> 24:37.880
(chuckles)

24:39.279 --> 24:40.279
Well... (sighs)

24:42.079 --> 24:43.239
...it's a start.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.799
(scoffs)

24:46.079 --> 24:48.000
(laid-back music playing)

24:51.799 --> 24:55.359
Bro, we got nine races to catch
the eye of another team, you know.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.758
And as your manager, I have to advise you

24:57.759 --> 25:00.199
that we need to start hitting
these social and sponsor events.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.838
You need more engagement, Josh,
more followers.

25:01.839 --> 25:04.000
- All right, deal.
- All right, cool. I'm just saying, innit?

25:05.039 --> 25:06.119
You eaten? I'm starving.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.599
Nah.

25:08.079 --> 25:09.278
Gotta see someone though.

25:09.279 --> 25:11.959
Yeah? Hey, take a picture, post that shit.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.518
Send it to me, I'll post that shit.

25:13.519 --> 25:14.959
It's my mum.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.558
Don't you dare post that shit.

25:16.559 --> 25:17.679
(laughs)

25:17.680 --> 25:19.640
I knew you was gonna say that.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.318
(music ends)

25:24.319 --> 25:25.598
(music plays softly on radio)

25:25.599 --> 25:26.880
(phone chimes)

25:30.240 --> 25:32.119
- (clicks tongue, sighs)
- Okay, baby?

25:32.599 --> 25:34.200
Yeah. Just tired.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.480
Bad tires or the engine?

25:37.359 --> 25:38.838
Come on, Mum.
You don't know about the cars.

25:38.839 --> 25:41.038
(chuckles) Facety.

25:41.039 --> 25:44.359
All right, I may not know much about cars,
but I know a lot about you.

25:45.000 --> 25:45.960
Go.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.318
(sighs)

25:48.319 --> 25:50.759
I might lose my seat
if the team don't win a race.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.680
Any race.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.518
There are other teams?

25:54.519 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, there's 20 seats,
but they're all filled.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.278
Plus, there's this new guy, and... (sighs)

25:59.279 --> 26:00.318
...he's old.

26:00.319 --> 26:01.518
How old?

26:01.519 --> 26:03.999
Like, really old. Like... 80.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.759
(laughs)

26:07.359 --> 26:09.039
He's such an arsehole, Mum.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.920
He's quick, though.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.798
Don't mind that.

26:12.799 --> 26:14.358
Focus on you.

26:14.359 --> 26:16.558
You can spend your whole life
worrying about other people,

26:16.559 --> 26:18.920
but your time is right now.

26:20.799 --> 26:21.880
You still love it?

26:23.359 --> 26:24.639
Course I still love it.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.839
Then remember what
your father used to say.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.079
"Put your head down and drive."

26:31.160 --> 26:32.118
Yes, ma'am.

26:32.119 --> 26:33.879
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles)

26:33.880 --> 26:35.200
(jaunty music playing)

26:48.400 --> 26:50.519
- (bells ring)
- (cows moo)

26:53.720 --> 26:55.318
(bicycle bell rings)

26:55.319 --> 26:57.879
(herder 1) Come on, then. It's all good.
Come on. Come on, then.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.680
Come on. Come on.

27:00.279 --> 27:02.239
- Come here. Come on, then.
- You're kiddin' me.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.318
(herders clamoring)

27:04.319 --> 27:06.959
(herder 2) Don't park there.
It's just a car. Quieten down.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.240
Come on, eh? Come on.

27:14.279 --> 27:15.559
(music ends)

27:17.279 --> 27:19.559
Thought your job was to build
the fastest car on the planet.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.480
(chuckles) My job is wind.

27:23.319 --> 27:25.240
So, helps to feel it.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.479
Mmm. (sighs)

27:27.480 --> 27:28.919
("Bright Lights" playing)

27:28.920 --> 27:31.278
Mysterious moves at Apex GP,

27:31.279 --> 27:34.879
who have finally announced the driver
who will take their second seat.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.959
And in a bizarre twist,
it's American Sonny Hayes,

27:37.960 --> 27:41.159
who hasn't raced in Formula 1
for over three decades.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.879
Son of an IndyCar mechanic,

27:42.880 --> 27:46.278
Hayes was considered something
of a reckless young phenomenon,

27:46.279 --> 27:48.518
the greatest who never was.

27:48.519 --> 27:51.278
His former career
being brought to an abrupt halt

27:51.279 --> 27:54.039
by a horrific accident
at the Spanish Grand Prix.

27:54.559 --> 27:57.639
He reappeared a decade later
in racing championships

27:57.640 --> 28:00.919
as diverse as Le Mans,
NASCAR, the Dakar Rally,

28:00.920 --> 28:03.758
and even a stint as
a New York taxi driver.

28:03.759 --> 28:05.679
- Oh, no.
- (crowd applauding)

28:05.680 --> 28:07.679
(Will Buxton) But now he's back
racing for a team which has,

28:07.680 --> 28:12.078
in its entire F1 history,
never even finished in the top ten.

28:12.079 --> 28:13.999
None of this will dampen speculation

28:14.000 --> 28:18.239
that majority shareholder Cervantes
Capital are looking to sell the team.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.879
And if they do,
that will likely also bring an end

28:20.880 --> 28:23.558
to the career of F1 rookie Joshua Pearce.

28:23.559 --> 28:25.318
- Can we go now?
- "Desperate times," they say,

28:25.319 --> 28:26.719
"call for desperate measures,"

28:26.720 --> 28:29.439
but I honestly cannot recall
a driver signing

28:29.440 --> 28:31.400
- quite as desperate as this.
- Let's go.

28:32.599 --> 28:35.118
Boy, look at my son.

28:35.119 --> 28:37.078
- (Joshua) Huh? (chuckles)
- Hey. (laughs)

28:37.079 --> 28:38.798
- (manager) That's the one.
- (Joshua's mom) Huh.

28:38.799 --> 28:40.999
- (music ends)
- That's the other driver?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.719
Yep. That's him and his stupid face.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.199
But, wait, you said he was old.
He not that old.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.639
(manager) Hey, Josh.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.160
You want a next shot anywhere?

28:49.279 --> 28:52.039
Nine races means nine times
you have to beat Chuck Norris.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.159
For now, start by winning over the press.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.239
- Yeah? You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.400
Cool. Let's go.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.879
- (sighs)
- Mmm.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.880
That's a handsome man right there.
(chuckles)

29:05.559 --> 29:10.719
(Will Buxton) Joshua. Hey. Um, it's been
an undeniably messy start to your season.

29:10.720 --> 29:16.399
No wins, car problems throughout,
and now you have another new teammate.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.119
How exactly are you finding it?

29:18.880 --> 29:21.719
Messy start doesn't mean
you can't finish neat. All right?

29:21.720 --> 29:25.399
Apex have a fire crew of engineers,
so I'm confident we'll come back fightin'.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.279
In terms of new teammates,

29:28.039 --> 29:31.318
I think it's really wonderful that Apex
are giving second chances to the elderly.

29:31.319 --> 29:33.318
(all laugh)

29:33.319 --> 29:36.000
Ah, yes. Next question.
Thank you. Yes, Don. Yeah.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.518
Mr. Hayes. Hi. Don Cavendish.
Um, welcome back to the UK.

29:39.519 --> 29:40.879
It's been a while, mmm?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.518
I mean, last time
you raced at Silverstone,

29:42.519 --> 29:45.959
Bill Clinton was your president,
and we were all dancing the Macarena.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.559
- So, uh, it must be surreal to be back.
- (reporters laugh)

29:50.759 --> 29:51.759
Yeah.

29:53.799 --> 29:56.318
And, uh, during that decade,
you gave up racing,

29:56.319 --> 29:58.318
and, uh, gambled professionally?

29:58.319 --> 29:59.359
Uh-huh.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.598
Before declaring yourself
personally bankrupt?

30:02.599 --> 30:03.919
Yep.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.798
(Don) You had a marriage annulled
and two more ended in divorce?

30:06.799 --> 30:08.160
Yep.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.519
Anything you wish you'd done differently?

30:13.240 --> 30:14.199
Yeah.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.359
(reporters murmuring)

30:17.400 --> 30:19.798
(chuckles) No more questions.
Thank you. Yes. Thank you.

30:19.799 --> 30:24.118
(reporters clamoring)

30:24.119 --> 30:26.640
(somber orchestral music playing)

30:32.440 --> 30:35.000
(grunts)

30:42.160 --> 30:43.318
(music becomes electronic, dramatic)

30:43.319 --> 30:44.558
(panting)

30:44.559 --> 30:47.758
(breathing heavily)

30:47.759 --> 30:50.038
(grunts)

(sighs)

31:17.119 --> 31:20.079
(people chattering)

31:35.200 --> 31:36.160
(Joshua) Yes, Dodge.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.078
What time was he here?

31:41.079 --> 31:42.160
Before me.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.758
- And before you.
- (Joshua sighs)

31:50.759 --> 31:51.879
(music fades)

31:51.880 --> 31:54.518
(people cheering)

(ball bouncing in distance)

31:57.680 --> 31:58.960
(sighs)

32:02.039 --> 32:04.199
Okay, here he comes. Apologize.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.839
(scoffs) Apologize? I can't do that.

32:06.319 --> 32:08.999
- How you mean? Why not?
- Because it's a sign of weakness.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.078
It's a sign of strength.

32:10.079 --> 32:11.319
Sign of weakness.

32:11.839 --> 32:13.358
You hard ears, just do it.

32:13.359 --> 32:14.639
Mum, I can't.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.240
You can. You will.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.839
(sighs)

32:20.759 --> 32:21.920
(sucks teeth)

32:24.119 --> 32:25.279
(sighs)

32:28.039 --> 32:29.000
Hey, man.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.960
Other day at the press conference,
stuff I said wasn't cool.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.358
(muttering) You say sorry.

32:36.359 --> 32:41.318
So, basically what I'm trying to say is...
I'm sorry.

32:41.319 --> 32:44.240
It's all right. You're just worried I'm
quicker than you. Hi, I'm Sonny.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.839
Oh, Bernadette Pearce. Nice to meet you.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.679
Pleasure.
It's all good. I'll see you out there.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.078
(scoffs)

32:51.079 --> 32:53.000
(ball bouncing)

32:56.400 --> 32:58.318
(pop song playing, muffled)

32:58.319 --> 32:59.359
(sighs)

33:00.519 --> 33:01.758
(sighs) How are you feeling?

33:01.759 --> 33:03.279
- So good.
- Good.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.440
- You good?
- Good.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.880
Good.

33:09.920 --> 33:10.879
No pressure.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.920
None.

33:13.039 --> 33:14.000
(sighs)

33:17.119 --> 33:18.919
- Great.
- Great. (clears throat)

33:18.920 --> 33:20.119
Great.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.439
(Croft) Welcome along to Silverstone,

33:22.440 --> 33:27.879
the circuit where on the 13th of May 1950
the Formula 1 World Championship began.

33:27.880 --> 33:32.399
Today, we kick off the final nine races
of this thrilling championship season

33:32.400 --> 33:35.518
here at the 77th British Grand Prix.

33:35.519 --> 33:37.959
(Brundle) As always,
11 teams will take the grid,

33:37.960 --> 33:39.879
fielding two drivers each.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.598
With race order determined
by the qualifying times set yesterday.

33:43.599 --> 33:45.598
Red Bull will start on pole

33:45.599 --> 33:49.000
followed by the two McLarens
and two Ferraris.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.519
(Croft) Drivers,
two minutes to national anthem.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.840
("We Will Rock You" playing)

34:20.239 --> 34:21.280
Sonny!

34:22.159 --> 34:23.919
Ah, Ruben.
Don't make me talk to the money.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.158
Come on, give me a moment.
Just smile and shake hands.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.839
He's an important member of the board.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.319
Sonny, this is Peter Banning,

34:29.320 --> 34:30.558
- one of my investors.
- Hi.

34:30.559 --> 34:31.598
Hi.

34:31.599 --> 34:33.558
He knows absolutely nothing about racing...

34:33.559 --> 34:36.078
- Yeah.
- ...but he's my eyes and ears on the board.

34:36.079 --> 34:38.439
And, uh, you're Ruben's Hail Mary.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.118
Now, that is
an American football term, right?

34:40.119 --> 34:41.678
The Hail Mary, the long shot. The--

34:41.679 --> 34:43.118
I believe it's a religious term, originally.

34:43.119 --> 34:44.158
That is true. That is true.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.879
I'm praying to them all.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.118
I'm the one guy on the board
who actually wants to keep the team.

34:48.119 --> 34:49.959
The rest are calling it, you know,
Ruben's Inferno.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.678
But, seriously, man, I'm hooked.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.118
I've binged all of Drive to Survive .

34:54.119 --> 34:57.158
I honestly don't think I've ever known
so much about car tires. It's incredible.

34:57.159 --> 34:58.359
I'm gonna get back to my day job.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.118
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:00.119 --> 35:01.479
("We Will Rock You" continues)

35:01.480 --> 35:03.679
Hey, man.
We're counting on you. Good luck.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.559
What are you doing here, Sonny?

36:16.880 --> 36:19.399
(Croft) And as the clock ticks then
to the top of the hour,

36:19.400 --> 36:22.118
it's time to get things going here
at Silverstone.

36:22.119 --> 36:23.759
It's formation lap first.

36:23.760 --> 36:28.639
One tour of the track and a chance for the
drivers to warm up their tires and brakes.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.839
(Brundle) Oh, no.
There's a problem for Apex.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.038
That's Hayes in P22. His car hasn't moved.

36:37.039 --> 36:39.118
Hang on. I got power trouble.

36:39.119 --> 36:41.518
It's start mode, Sonny.

36:41.519 --> 36:42.879
Start mode on.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.879
(Brundle) Yes,
a lesson for everyone at home.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.919
New car? Do read the manual.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.279
(Croft) It's been a while since he was
out on the track. At this rate...

36:49.280 --> 36:51.359
- Dios mío.
- ...he's not even gonna get into the race.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.400
Ay.

36:53.880 --> 36:54.920
- I got it.
- (engine revs)

36:55.039 --> 36:55.960
All good.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.439
(Croft) And he's away at last.
Thank goodness for that.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.799
(Brundle) If he falls too far behind
on the formation lap...

37:02.800 --> 37:03.839
- Drink?
- ...he'll be at risk...

37:03.840 --> 37:06.239
- Eh? No.
- ...of having to start in the pit lane.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.799
Where's Sonny? He's holding us up.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.119
Yeah. Just checking, Joshua.
Just checking.

37:13.239 --> 37:15.118
- What's wrong with his car?
- What? Nothing.

37:15.119 --> 37:16.558
(Brundle) With a clear track ahead,

37:16.559 --> 37:19.718
Hayes has been able
to push much harder on this formation lap.

37:19.719 --> 37:23.079
He'll turn up at the back of the grid
with warm tires, ready to go.

37:24.199 --> 37:26.639
Cheeky shit. It's on purpose.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.598
What is this guy doing?

37:32.599 --> 37:36.399
(Croft) This is actually now
turning into an advantage for Sonny Hayes.

37:36.400 --> 37:40.440
(Brundle) And he's just made it in time.
Watch out for his start.

37:49.039 --> 37:53.038
(Croft) Five lights ahead of the drivers.
It's lights out and away we go!

37:53.039 --> 37:54.199
(crowd cheering)

38:05.559 --> 38:07.678
Here comes Sonny Hayes,
ladies and gentlemen.

38:07.679 --> 38:11.399
Using those warm tires to carve his way
through the back of the field.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.238
(Brundle) And if you ever need
confidence in your car,

38:14.239 --> 38:15.719
it's here at Silverstone.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.678
Hayes is just sailing past people.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.558
He's moved up seven places
since the start.

38:36.559 --> 38:39.359
- Apex GP has struggled with this car...
- Yes!

38:39.360 --> 38:41.638
...but they've brought an upgrade package
this weekend.

38:41.639 --> 38:45.480
Let's see if it makes a difference
as Hayes attacks Perez in the Red Bull.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.000
Car's bouncing around this dirty air.
I can't position to attack.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.038
(Brundle) Hayes complaining
about his car over the radio.

38:55.039 --> 38:57.759
That's not what the team wants to hear.

38:57.760 --> 39:00.879
Copy. Gap is 0.9 to Perez.
You're within DRS range.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.039
Should be able to take him
on the next straight.

39:05.599 --> 39:08.999
(Croft) Hayes now using
the drag reduction system to get past.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.439
- (cheering)
- Yeah!

39:10.440 --> 39:12.598
Won't be able to hold him off, guys.
I got no grip.

39:12.599 --> 39:14.598
- This is trouble now for Apex GP.
- Oh, come on.

39:14.599 --> 39:16.359
The Red Bull's tires are now warm

39:16.360 --> 39:19.839
and Hayes hasn't got his tire advantage
from the start anymore.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.158
We've seen the attack.
Now it's all about defense.

39:23.159 --> 39:25.839
And Perez on the attack into Vale.

39:25.840 --> 39:29.078
Hayes is in trouble.
This could be the places reversed.

39:29.079 --> 39:31.038
- (crowd cheering)
- And it is.

39:31.039 --> 39:32.078
Damn.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.118
Rear end is loose.
Tell me if you see a fix.

39:34.119 --> 39:36.879
Tell him to pull back the entry
to get a better exit.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.079
He-He thinks it's the setup. It's not.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.439
(Croft) Twenty laps down.

39:42.440 --> 39:46.279
Verstappen leads but Joshua Pearce
is struggling out there at the moment.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.118
Guys, get me off these softs.
I'm going backwards.

39:49.119 --> 39:51.839
Copy that. Lap 20. Box, box.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.238
(Brundle) Stakes couldn't be higher
for rookie Joshua Pearce.

39:54.239 --> 39:57.800
This is not where you want to be,
in last place.

40:00.119 --> 40:01.599
(groans) I'm jammed. Back up!

40:08.440 --> 40:09.759
Hit something. What was that?

40:09.760 --> 40:10.799
(crowd shrieks)

40:10.800 --> 40:13.238
(Croft) Ooh, a seven-second pit stop.

40:13.239 --> 40:15.279
Apex GP won't be happy with that.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.158
That's double the time it should've taken.

40:18.159 --> 40:19.718
Lost the rears. Box, box.

40:19.719 --> 40:21.639
Copy. Go to plan B. Box, box.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.919
(Croft) And here comes Sonny Hayes
for a fresh set of tires.

40:24.920 --> 40:29.558
He'll be hoping these will help him
hold on to his current position of P15.

40:29.559 --> 40:30.518
Front jacks! Front jacks!

40:30.519 --> 40:32.158
(Brundle) The front jack has
not worked properly.

40:32.159 --> 40:35.359
- You're kidding me.
- This is causing absolute pandemonium

40:35.360 --> 40:37.639
in the Apex GP pit lane.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.639
Whatever could go wrong
is going wrong for this team.

40:45.679 --> 40:49.118
(Croft) And coming out of the pit,
Hayes just ahead of his teammate.

40:49.119 --> 40:53.479
As Pearce and Hayes go battling it out
here at Silverstone.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.760
Coming for you, old man.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.559
Got the pace, man.
Tell him to let me pass.

41:03.679 --> 41:05.238
Yeah. Copy. Hold position. Stand by. Kate.

41:05.239 --> 41:07.960
Josh is faster. Sonny is on cold tires.

41:13.239 --> 41:14.800
Yeah, okay, Sonny, no fighting.
Let him through.

41:20.119 --> 41:22.158
Sonny, no fighting.

41:22.159 --> 41:23.638
Who's fighting? I'm racing.

41:23.639 --> 41:25.999
(Croft) Pearce on the inside,
Hayes on the outside.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.319
(Brundle) Hayes trying
to make him eat concrete

41:28.320 --> 41:29.999
up against the old pit wall there.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.158
Joshua, you're gonna
have to fight for position.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.198
You are racing Sonny.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.319
A-ffirm.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.799
(Brundle) They're giving
absolutely no quarter.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.718
No benefit to their teammate at all.

41:38.719 --> 41:41.359
They're pushing as if
they're trying to win a Grand Prix.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.518
(Croft) But this is the battle
for last place, remember?

41:44.519 --> 41:45.718
And what a brawl it is.

41:45.719 --> 41:47.159
Let's go, kid. Bring it.

41:50.559 --> 41:52.238
What is this guy doing? Let me through.

41:52.239 --> 41:54.440
(crowd cheering)

42:02.039 --> 42:03.000
(spectators gasp)

42:08.000 --> 42:09.759
(Croft) Round the final corner.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.919
It's close!

42:10.920 --> 42:12.479
They make contact.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.879
- Both Apex GP cars into the gravel,
- (Sonny grunts)

42:15.880 --> 42:17.879
and Pearce hits the barrier.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.839
(crowd clamoring)

42:19.840 --> 42:21.119
- Ah, no!
- No!

42:21.800 --> 42:22.919
(Brundle) This is mad.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.118
The cardinal sin of motor racing.

42:25.119 --> 42:26.759
- A double DNF.
- (Ruben groans)

42:26.760 --> 42:30.558
Just when it couldn't get any worse
for the black and gold.

42:30.559 --> 42:32.239
- (Peter) That's a tough one, man.
- (mutters, sighing)

42:37.599 --> 42:39.880
(crowd shrieking, booing)

42:47.920 --> 42:49.158
We can't corner.

42:49.159 --> 42:51.718
We're bouncing around the place
like we're on the bloody Tube

42:51.719 --> 42:53.920
and now we think it's cool
to leave wheel guns in the pit box.

42:54.519 --> 42:55.479
Who even was that?

42:55.480 --> 42:57.639
- That was me.
- Of course.

43:00.159 --> 43:01.119
Old man.

43:03.960 --> 43:06.519
You losing your hearing? What was that?

43:07.519 --> 43:08.439
You wanna do this here?

43:08.440 --> 43:10.718
Yeah, I'd love to do this here
in front of the team, right.

43:10.719 --> 43:12.078
The one that you're apparently a part of.

43:12.079 --> 43:14.799
- Okay. You made a mistake. It happens.
- (laughs)

43:14.800 --> 43:16.479
I made a mistake. I love this guy, man.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.839
- Don't worry about it, Jodie.
- Are you even listening to me?

43:18.840 --> 43:20.718
- Not really.
- (Kaspar) No!

43:20.719 --> 43:22.078
Stop.

43:22.079 --> 43:23.518
Joshua is right.

43:23.519 --> 43:25.118
An order is an order.

43:25.119 --> 43:27.920
May I remind you that you report to me?

43:31.440 --> 43:32.400
Cool.

43:33.159 --> 43:35.000
Just don't ask me to give up position.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.760
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.359
Hold up.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.959
You swan into our garage
like some entitled prick.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.759
- "Swan"?
- Calling us piss poor...

43:46.760 --> 43:48.399
- What's "swan"?
- ...and then you drive like that. Huh?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.279
You said I "swan." What's that mean?

43:50.280 --> 43:52.959
You. You're an arsehole.
You come in like an arsehole. You swan.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.639
So swans are assholes?

43:56.599 --> 43:59.239
You're making the mistake of thinking
that I'm just gonna be some grateful kid

43:59.360 --> 44:01.000
who'll bend a knee to an old-timer.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.760
I climbed a mountain to get here, bro.

44:04.519 --> 44:05.558
Formula 1.

44:05.559 --> 44:08.279
Back home we call that
a participation trophy.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.198
(reporters) Joshua, Joshua! Josh!

44:10.199 --> 44:11.279
(clamoring)

44:11.280 --> 44:13.199
(chuckles) Yeah.

44:14.480 --> 44:16.718
What the hell are you smiling about, man?

44:16.719 --> 44:17.920
Did you win something?

44:18.440 --> 44:20.598
There's 20 other drivers
still out on that track

44:20.599 --> 44:22.598
and you're in here
posing for that nonsense.

44:22.599 --> 44:25.480
Do you think any of them respect us?
Do you?

44:26.559 --> 44:29.759
They need to learn that
no one gets past us without a fight.

44:29.760 --> 44:30.800
No one.

44:33.679 --> 44:36.320
You don't like the way I'm driving?
Beat me, swan.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.320
Hell of a race, huh?

44:44.840 --> 44:45.920
Whoo!

44:56.280 --> 44:59.599
(breathes deeply)

45:03.559 --> 45:06.639
Sorry, I didn't see you. Um... (sighs)

45:07.360 --> 45:09.279
(sighs) You still beating yourself up?

45:09.280 --> 45:10.518
Yeah.

45:10.519 --> 45:12.599
Yeah, I know that one. (chuckles)

45:14.840 --> 45:17.599
Um, thanks for what you said out there.

45:19.039 --> 45:21.679
Just don't do it again, okay?

45:22.360 --> 45:23.880
Makes me look like I need help.

45:24.559 --> 45:27.280
Oh, man. You're right. (sighs) Got it.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.799
Hey, for what it's worth,
don't be shitty to yourself.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.799
There's plenty of people out there
that'll do that for you.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.079
Yeah.

45:38.760 --> 45:39.880
(sighs)

45:42.199 --> 45:46.638
"I'm sorry, Ruben, for demolishing not one
but both of your lovely cars.

45:46.639 --> 45:49.078
For coming back into your life
only to destroy it."

45:49.079 --> 45:50.439
Is this your revenge for Monaco?

45:50.440 --> 45:51.879
Yeah, I waited 30 years

45:51.880 --> 45:55.158
and came all this way
to humiliate myself on global television.

45:55.159 --> 45:58.440
Funny. You think I brought you in
to make my other driver quit?

45:59.119 --> 46:02.439
Listen, he's cocky.
He's arrogant. He's got a lot to learn.

46:02.440 --> 46:04.440
(laughs)

46:05.920 --> 46:08.638
You were cocky, you were arrogant
and you had a lot to learn.

46:08.639 --> 46:11.359
I'm not here to hold anyone's hand.
I'm here to race.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.239
No, you're not, Sonny.
You're here to give me a heart attack.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.000
The board is up my ass

46:18.320 --> 46:20.638
and I have to decide
whether to continue this fiasco

46:20.639 --> 46:23.319
- or pull the plug now.
- You have till the end of the season.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.039
By which time Apex will be worth less
than my shoes!

46:26.719 --> 46:28.400
Sonny! God...

46:31.039 --> 46:32.000
Tell me about Kate.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.038
The car.
I wanna talk to her about the car.

46:35.039 --> 46:37.518
She's the world's first
female tech director of an F1 team.

46:37.519 --> 46:38.999
I mean, that takes balls.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Wow. Is that your line?

46:41.599 --> 46:42.598
She'll see right through it.

46:42.599 --> 46:43.759
It's not a line.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.039
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Is she married?

46:46.599 --> 46:49.678
Okay, stay there in that tub of ice
until Budapest.

46:49.679 --> 46:51.159
You don't move.

46:53.440 --> 46:54.559
Hey, Ruben...

46:56.559 --> 46:58.000
We can't get there with this car.

47:06.679 --> 47:07.679
(sighs)

47:42.519 --> 47:44.158
Hey. Hey.

47:44.159 --> 47:45.599
Yeah, sorry. Hi, hi, hi.

47:46.199 --> 47:47.159
What you working on?

47:47.840 --> 47:52.158
I'm working on a new front wing concept.
Trying to pick us up a tenth or so.

47:52.159 --> 47:55.558
Cool. And you can replicate turns?
Lateral airflow?

47:55.559 --> 47:57.359
No, just straight line drag.

47:57.360 --> 47:59.440
But, I mean,
we can calculate it from there.

48:00.159 --> 48:03.279
Okay, what about turbulent air
from a car we're following?

48:03.280 --> 48:05.198
No, not exactly, but--

48:05.199 --> 48:07.959
Track conditions, surface quality,
weather, ambient temps?

48:07.960 --> 48:12.078
(chuckles) I'm sorry, uh, is there
something that you wanted to discuss?

48:12.079 --> 48:14.639
Kate, you read my mind.

48:18.480 --> 48:22.158
So how does one get to be the first female
technical director of an F1 team?

48:22.159 --> 48:23.360
Must take...

48:26.559 --> 48:29.439
dedication and lots of hard work.

48:29.440 --> 48:32.759
- That's your urgent question?
- Hmm? Mm-mmm.

48:32.760 --> 48:36.598
Plenty of people think I don't belong here
and I'm happy to add you to the list

48:36.599 --> 48:38.399
if you're implying
what I... I think you're implying.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.718
As a rule I don't imply stuff.

48:39.719 --> 48:41.158
So you like straight talk?

48:41.159 --> 48:42.920
Straight as an arrow. No sugar.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.598
Everyone thinks Ruben's lost it.

48:45.599 --> 48:46.879
That he is clutching at straws.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.638
They're saying maybe he lost a bet.

48:48.639 --> 48:50.999
- Ran over your dog.
- (chuckles)

48:51.000 --> 48:55.480
They're saying Sonny Hayes
isn't a has-been.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.079
He's a never-was.

49:00.519 --> 49:03.039
Yeah, when I said I like straight talk
I meant me.

49:03.559 --> 49:06.718
From others, I mostly prefer praise,
flattery, hero worship,

49:06.719 --> 49:08.518
at times, straight-up bullshit.

49:08.519 --> 49:10.879
- Is that what Ruben's for?
- (laughs)

49:10.880 --> 49:13.238
Ruben. I love the guy.
Most solid, steadfast--

49:13.239 --> 49:14.638
Said you asked if I was married.

49:14.639 --> 49:17.960
Disloyal, mean, twisted,
bitter, husk of a man.

49:18.079 --> 49:24.078
Mmm, yeah. And he also told me about
a big string of ex-wives and girlfriends.

49:24.079 --> 49:25.678
He said to avoid you like the plague.

49:25.679 --> 49:28.960
Okay... (chuckles) ...let me explain this.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.198
When you're going 200 miles per hour
into Eau Rouge,

49:32.199 --> 49:34.360
it's good to know who's got your back.

49:35.559 --> 49:37.279
And for the record,
in all my years of racing,

49:37.280 --> 49:41.558
I have never ever hit on
the team technical director.

49:41.559 --> 49:45.679
(smacks lips) Well, now that's
a huge weight off my mind.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.518
So what's this urgent question?

49:51.519 --> 49:52.760
Okay.

49:53.599 --> 49:56.839
Red Bull, Ferrari,
Mercedes, Aston, now McLaren

49:56.840 --> 49:58.399
all have us beat on straight line speed.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.839
Our shot is battling in the turns.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.519
I need a way
to chase through the dirty air.

50:05.880 --> 50:09.839
You want me to redesign
so you can follow closer?

50:09.840 --> 50:11.360
We need to build our car for combat.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.598
Uh, how am I supposed to make that safe?

50:14.599 --> 50:16.079
Who said anything about safe?

50:18.480 --> 50:19.759
That's your question?

50:19.760 --> 50:20.999
Yeah.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.239
And here's the straight talk.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.320
It's urgent.

50:26.719 --> 50:28.239
(scoffs)

50:29.920 --> 50:32.399
You know,
I bet when you look in the mirror,

50:32.400 --> 50:38.678
you see this rough-and-tumble,
old school, no bullshit cowboy.

50:38.679 --> 50:41.718
Doesn't take orders.
Goes his own way. Huh?

50:41.719 --> 50:43.159
A lone wolf.

50:44.119 --> 50:45.558
Well, I have news for you.

50:45.559 --> 50:48.439
Formula 1 is a team sport. It always was.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.239
And maybe that's why you failed at it?

50:52.320 --> 50:55.999
The only question here is,
"Why did Sonny Hayes come back to F1?"

50:56.000 --> 51:00.480
Now that question
is extremely fucking urgent.

51:04.519 --> 51:07.800
I'll start listening to you
when you finish a race.

51:12.119 --> 51:13.079
(grumbles)

51:15.000 --> 51:16.440
(electronic pop song playing)

51:21.960 --> 51:23.800
Don't let me down

51:29.760 --> 51:32.599
Don't let me down

51:35.039 --> 51:37.759
Don't let me down

51:37.760 --> 51:38.879
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

51:38.880 --> 51:41.359
Don't let me drown

51:41.360 --> 51:43.238
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

51:43.239 --> 51:45.718
Don't let me down

51:45.719 --> 51:47.359
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

51:47.360 --> 51:51.239
Don't let me drown

51:55.480 --> 51:57.679
(song continues)

51:58.360 --> 52:00.360
Don't let me down

52:06.440 --> 52:09.119
Don't let me drown

52:12.159 --> 52:14.439
Nights like these

52:14.440 --> 52:18.079
There's something mystical
About nights like these

52:18.840 --> 52:21.238
And the concept of time don't matter

52:21.239 --> 52:22.879
(song fades)

52:22.880 --> 52:24.159
(brakes hiss)

52:25.360 --> 52:28.678
(Buxton) At the Spanish Grand Prix,
the American rookie Sonny Hayes

52:28.679 --> 52:32.518
had just signed a new contract,
and his future looked very bright.

52:32.519 --> 52:36.158
He'd earned a reputation
for his aggressive driving style.

52:36.159 --> 52:39.959
Seen by some as reckless,
it nevertheless served him well

52:39.960 --> 52:42.678
as he climbed up the order
over the course of the season,

52:42.679 --> 52:45.639
relentlessly pursuing
his first F1 victory.

52:47.280 --> 52:49.959
Hayes was running well
in the opening laps,

52:49.960 --> 52:52.558
chasing down race leader Ayrton Senna.

52:52.559 --> 52:54.718
However when Hayes made a risky move

52:54.719 --> 52:58.679
and attacked Senna on the outside of
a high-speed right-hand turn,

52:59.239 --> 53:02.479
a frightening scene unfolded
as quick as a flash.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.999
(commentator 1) My goodness!
I just saw him plunge off to the right.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.558
There you can see the debris on the right.

53:06.559 --> 53:09.118
What on earth happened there,
I don't know.

53:09.119 --> 53:10.518
(commentator 2)
Yes, this looks very severe indeed.

53:10.519 --> 53:13.839
I must say, it looks like, uh, he is...
he really needs help.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.678
There is nobody coming to him
at the moment.

53:15.679 --> 53:17.879
The race has been stopped.
The red flag is out.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.719
This looks a little bit like a--

53:36.280 --> 53:39.718
(Kate) Our models predict all teams
are gonna be targeting a one-stop race.

53:39.719 --> 53:43.880
Plan A is to switch from mediums to hards,
between lap 27 and 33.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.919
Plan B will be medium-hard-medium,
first window 16 to 21, second, 45 to 51.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.638
Plan C for softs doesn't make sense.

53:51.639 --> 53:53.840
At this temp,
the tire deg will be too high.

53:55.519 --> 53:56.480
Nothing else?

53:57.039 --> 53:58.799
- Yep.
- Yeah, Joshua?

53:58.800 --> 54:00.919
So, we've just got to
drive our race, all right?

54:00.920 --> 54:01.959
Let's not try and be heroes.

54:01.960 --> 54:04.038
Just make it through
those first turns clean.

54:04.039 --> 54:06.158
Can't win at lap one,
starting at the back,

54:06.159 --> 54:09.279
so we just gotta hope for some
lucky breaks later on, all right?

54:09.280 --> 54:10.479
- (crew member) Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.079
Create your own breaks.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.199
Um, hello, hi? I just said that.

54:16.440 --> 54:17.679
Hope is not a strategy.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.719
Anything else, Professor?

54:23.599 --> 54:25.480
Um... (sighs)

54:25.960 --> 54:27.000
Drive fast?

54:38.800 --> 54:42.718
- (crowd cheering)
- (timer beeps)

54:42.719 --> 54:43.759
(timer stops)

54:43.760 --> 54:45.999
(Croft) It's lights out, and away we go.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.638
Great start from Hamilton,
Verstappen battling with him.

54:48.639 --> 54:51.960
Piastri, Zhou, Leclerc...
and here come the two Apex GPs.

54:52.880 --> 54:57.119
But Gasly shuts the door,
leaving them with nowhere to go.

55:03.239 --> 55:06.479
Into turn one,
and there's three cars gone off.

55:06.480 --> 55:09.558
Gasly, Ocon, and the AlphaTauri, Tsunoda.

55:09.559 --> 55:10.879
(Sonny) Hit debris. Check my tires.

55:10.880 --> 55:13.558
Yeah, you've got a puncture. Right rear.
Box. Box this lap.

55:13.559 --> 55:15.639
First goddamn turn. A ruined race.

55:16.559 --> 55:19.000
(Sonny) Oh, shit, shit, shit. Ah, shit.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.800
He's coming in! Let's go.

55:24.360 --> 55:25.799
(Sonny) Let's go Plan C.

55:25.800 --> 55:30.078
No, Plan C is for soft tires.
They won't last ten laps in this heat. No.

55:30.079 --> 55:31.279
That's a negative, Sonny. Plan A.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.799
(Sonny) Plan A is called Plan A 'cause
it's when everything is going right.

55:33.800 --> 55:34.840
You see anything going right?

55:35.519 --> 55:37.118
Plan C. Softs.

55:37.119 --> 55:40.199
It's not his call.
Tell him A, as in "asshole."

55:40.920 --> 55:42.518
Okay, let's go! Turn 'em out! Hard tires.

55:42.519 --> 55:44.000
(Sonny) Softs, goddamn it.

55:49.199 --> 55:52.038
- What's wrong with the car?
- The guy sitting in it.

55:52.039 --> 55:56.638
Are you insane? We need hard tires.
Everybody here is at a one-stop race.

55:56.639 --> 55:58.719
(Sonny) We do what
everybody does, we lose.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.840
- Make him go!
- How?

56:02.559 --> 56:05.439
You think I don't know my tires?
I was a mechanic.

56:05.440 --> 56:09.079
Five championship titles
with my bare freaking hands!

56:12.000 --> 56:12.960
Give him his tires.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.759
- (Hugh) Okay, let's go.
- Go, go, change!

56:15.760 --> 56:17.400
Let's go, let's go! Change quick, now!

56:22.519 --> 56:23.479
(Sonny) Be ready.

56:23.480 --> 56:25.119
Ready for what?

56:32.119 --> 56:35.079
- Where's JP sitting?
- (Hugh) Currently running P14.

56:37.280 --> 56:38.679
(Sonny) All right, here we go now.

56:39.159 --> 56:40.399
(Croft) Hayes makes his move,

56:40.400 --> 56:42.959
chasing Kevin Magnussen.
It's a late lunge!

56:42.960 --> 56:44.558
(Brundle) He's damaged his front wing.

56:44.559 --> 56:49.279
Any driver knows Magnussen will shut
the door on a clumsy move like that.

56:49.280 --> 56:51.038
(Sonny) Aw, dagnabbit.

56:51.039 --> 56:52.479
Plan C for "chaos."

56:52.480 --> 56:53.638
(chuckles)

56:53.639 --> 56:56.879
(Croft) So that will bring out a
safety car, which always shakes up a race.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.879
Slows down the leaders,
leaves the field bunched up together,

56:59.880 --> 57:02.198
and gives teams
the chance for a quick pit stop,

57:02.199 --> 57:04.518
which only costs half the usual time.

57:04.519 --> 57:05.999
(Joshua) Safety car. We're boxing, right?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.279
Standby. Kate,

57:07.280 --> 57:09.638
shouldn't we take advantage
while the safety car window is open?

57:09.639 --> 57:11.718
It's early. We gain track position
if we stay out.

57:11.719 --> 57:15.038
(Rico) Stay out, stay out.
Want you out. Push, push, Joshua.

57:15.039 --> 57:17.118
(Brundle) So, the midfield moves up
for the moment,

57:17.119 --> 57:19.440
including Joshua Pearce to P12.

57:20.079 --> 57:22.239
(Joshua) This guy better not
be messing up my race.

57:27.519 --> 57:28.479
Where's JP now?

57:28.480 --> 57:29.960
Currently running P12.

57:36.400 --> 57:38.280
Okay. Plan C. Be ready.

57:39.199 --> 57:40.559
He's gonna do it again.

57:44.079 --> 57:46.319
(Croft) Back marker Hayes
is now down a lap.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.598
He has to let Bottas pass,
or face a five-second penalty.

57:49.599 --> 57:52.238
(Brundle) Hayes is making it
very difficult for Bottas.

57:52.239 --> 57:55.359
Under the rules he has to let him through
before passing three blue flags,

57:55.360 --> 57:57.038
or risk a penalty.

57:57.039 --> 58:00.199
Hey, I'm just putting it out there,
but, uh, maybe you should drive.

58:01.639 --> 58:04.280
(Hugh) Sonny, you've gotten the blue flag.
Let Bottas through.

58:05.119 --> 58:06.800
(Sonny) Come on, now. Little closer.

58:08.679 --> 58:10.198
(Hugh) Sonny, do you copy?

58:10.199 --> 58:11.920
(Sonny) I hear ya. Lettin' him through.

58:13.360 --> 58:14.638
Whoops, my bad.

58:14.639 --> 58:16.479
(Croft) And that's his front wing again!

58:16.480 --> 58:19.319
Oh, that's gonna bring out
another safety car.

58:19.320 --> 58:22.238
Given that each wing
costs more than £200,000,

58:22.239 --> 58:24.920
I think the team might want
Sonny to start chipping in there.

58:25.519 --> 58:26.639
(chuckles)

58:29.920 --> 58:32.078
(Joshua) Guys, it's another free stop.
Please tell me we're boxing.

58:32.079 --> 58:33.558
(Rico) Uh, we're checking.

58:33.559 --> 58:36.078
- Keep him out.
- Stay out. Stay out. You are staying out.

58:36.079 --> 58:38.319
(Croft) More drivers come in
to take fresh tires,

58:38.320 --> 58:42.480
but still, Joshua Pearce remains on track.
He's moved up to P11.

58:45.199 --> 58:46.559
Look who's back.

58:50.159 --> 58:51.800
I know, I know. Be ready.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.400
What is he doing?

58:58.079 --> 58:59.320
I think he's trying to score us a point.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.880
(Sonny) Tell JP to save his tires.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.558
Joshua, just take care of
your tires, okay?

59:07.559 --> 59:09.279
You have to make them last.

59:09.280 --> 59:12.039
(Joshua) Last? No shit. I will be.

59:15.039 --> 59:17.718
(Brundle) With four laps to go
in this stop-and-go race,

59:17.719 --> 59:18.919
thanks to Sonny Hayes,

59:18.920 --> 59:21.638
the driver helped most is his teammate,
now in tenth.

59:21.639 --> 59:24.519
With a 12-second gap ahead of Stroll.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.879
Tell JP to maintain that gap.

59:26.880 --> 59:28.079
Keep pushing.

59:29.239 --> 59:31.678
(Joshua) My tires are gone, man.
What are you waiting for?

59:31.679 --> 59:33.479
Copy that. We have to call it.

59:33.480 --> 59:34.960
He's losing over a second every lap.

59:35.639 --> 59:36.759
Stand by.

59:36.760 --> 59:40.439
(Croft) Into turn two. Hayes battles with
the Williams and pushes it wide.

59:40.440 --> 59:42.320
Seriously, what are we waiting for?

59:45.719 --> 59:46.718
(Croft) Sonny's off the track.

59:46.719 --> 59:49.439
He's gone too far over. (groans)

59:49.440 --> 59:50.839
And that's gonna cause damage.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.480
- Plan C.
- (laughs)

59:54.079 --> 59:55.718
Oopsie. Sorry, guys.

59:55.719 --> 59:59.558
(Croft) That's the third safety car
involving the Apex GP driver,

59:59.559 --> 01:00:02.599
bringing the Hungarian Grand Prix
to an absolute crawl.

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:05.198
A sub three-second stop,
and he'll keep P10.

01:00:05.199 --> 01:00:06.558
Box, Joshua. Box, box, box.

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.119
(Joshua) Copy. Coming in.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.598
What did you say?

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:14.038
(Brundle) Joshua Pearce
finally gets to pit.

01:00:14.039 --> 01:00:17.639
(Croft) And with a quick stop here,
he could stay in the top ten.

01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:26.198
(grunts)

01:00:26.199 --> 01:00:28.198
(Brundle) This is critical.

01:00:28.199 --> 01:00:32.440
Pearce must beat Stroll to the
pit exit line to maintain tenth place.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.158
(Croft) And he's done it!

01:00:35.159 --> 01:00:38.839
With yellow flags out, all the cars
are forced to hold track position,

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.959
- meaning that thanks to Sonny Hayes...
- (Joshua) Let's go!

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.158
- ...the race ends under a safety car.
- Yeah!

01:00:43.159 --> 01:00:45.000
- Vegas!
- What? Whoa!

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.119
Hey, yeah. Fuck you. (laughs)

01:00:50.119 --> 01:00:52.359
Yeah! (laughs, grunts)

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.718
Yes, baby!

01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:56.679
(crowd cheering)

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.879
(Joshua chuckles) You're crazy, bro.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.400
(Sonny) It's just tenth.
What are you smiling about?

01:01:10.639 --> 01:01:12.399
(Croft) And behind our podium placings,

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.959
Hamilton and Piastri
complete the top five,

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.759
- and Joshua Pearce in tenth...
- Wow.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.359
- ...scoring Expensify Apex GP...
- Yeah, baby.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.960
...their first ever point.

01:01:23.119 --> 01:01:25.638
Did you see me? Crazy, right?

01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:28.439
- (Sonny) A deal's a deal. I finished.
- Yeah, in last place.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.400
Sounds great when you say it.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.198
(interviewer) I know you have to go
see the stewards later,

01:01:38.199 --> 01:01:39.799
what do you think they're
gonna make of your race today?

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.879
Well, I have to admit,
you guys got this one right.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.599
- I'm, like... Thank you. Thank you.
- Good job. Yeah.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:48.038
I'm still a bit rusty and, you know,
finding my way with this car,

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:49.479
but I'm confident we'll get there.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.279
A rope-a-dope at Silverstone,
a demolition derby here in Hungary...

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.598
You've been banned from casinos.

01:01:54.599 --> 01:01:56.959
Are you trying to get banned from F1?
Take the whole team down with you?

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.239
Tell you what, Don,
what do you say we make a bet?

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.399
Your £10 against my 10 grand.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.198
We place at Monza, I win your 10.
We don't, you win mine.

01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:05.799
- (scoffs)
- Let's do this, man.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.119
Put your money where your mouth is.

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:10.118
What the hell? I'll take that.

01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:11.879
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.439
Hey. No more press.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.598
No, Sonny, you don't wanna make
the media your enemy.

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:17.879
And you'll be fined.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.039
Take it out of my paycheck.

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:20.920
We don't pay you enough.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.400
You know, I have to say.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840
I kinda like it.

01:02:27.199 --> 01:02:30.359
It's very sort of punk rock for the brand.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.639
(Peter sighs)

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.280
(Ruben) Hmm.

01:02:42.719 --> 01:02:43.920
Let's run it again.

01:02:52.039 --> 01:02:53.320
How long's he been in there?

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.320
All day. Playing with different
tire pressures, ride heights.

01:02:58.599 --> 01:02:59.800
What were his times?

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.320
He found half a second.

01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:08.000
Give me the same setup as him.

01:03:08.679 --> 01:03:10.760
(typing)

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:30.558
It must be late. I'm seeing double.

01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:31.599
(Kate chuckles)

01:03:32.599 --> 01:03:34.960
A deal's a deal.
I'm building her for combat.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.479
At the Dutch Grand Prix,

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.759
you'll be entering the Tarzan Corner
at 322 kilometers per hour.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.919
Yeah. Too late to change my mind?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.559
- Yeah.
- (chuckles)

01:03:51.719 --> 01:03:53.439
To answer your question,

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.039
I was in aerospace at Lockheed
when Ruben came in and...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.999
He liked my work, liked my attitude,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.039
and he sold me on the thrill of fighting
to the death for a tenth of a second.

01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:08.400
Traveling the world, the roar of a crowd...

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.880
So, I ran the idea past my husband.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.039
Who swiftly became my ex-husband.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.320
Good night.

01:04:21.239 --> 01:04:22.199
Good night.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.198
(line ringing)

01:04:46.199 --> 01:04:47.719
(Ruben) Do you know what time it is?

01:04:48.519 --> 01:04:49.759
All right.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.280
Tell me about the kid.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.638
Okay, here's another one my dad would say.

01:04:59.639 --> 01:05:01.760
"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."

01:05:02.639 --> 01:05:04.919
For what it's worth. One more time around?

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.959
- Just one? Come on. Is that all?
- (Sonny chuckles)

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.479
- (grunts)
- I'd never live with myself,

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.879
if I can't keep up with you, Mr. 1990s.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.440
- (chuckles)
- Let's go!

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.198
Joining us today,
we have Kaspar Smolinski,

01:05:16.199 --> 01:05:18.319
Zak Brown and Fred Vasseur.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.678
Now, Kaspar, can we start with you,
after what was a fantastic result

01:05:21.679 --> 01:05:23.999
- for the team in Hungary last time out...
- Thank you.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.078
...but Sonny has got you skirting the line
of penalties and violations.

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:31.279
Is this your only strategy,

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.158
and have you got any spare parts left
in the factory?

01:05:34.159 --> 01:05:35.678
(audience chuckling)

01:05:35.679 --> 01:05:37.078
We compete like everybody else.

01:05:37.079 --> 01:05:38.439
Race models change.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.039
We must adapt, huh?

01:05:40.599 --> 01:05:42.078
Well, Zak, can we bring you in on this?

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:47.079
Because you've faced Hayes before,
you know the gray areas in which he works.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.879
Certainly do. Uh, first of all,
he's a lot grayer now.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.879
- (audience chuckles)
- And, uh, we keep tabs on him,

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.198
you know, back there behind us.

01:05:54.199 --> 01:05:57.238
- (audience chuckles)
- And Fred, any concerns from Ferrari?

01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:59.360
What does Ferrari think of Apex?

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.959
- We don't.
- (audience chuckling)

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.880
("Hold Me" playing)

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.119
(fans clamoring) Sonny! You're the best!

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:25.759
(Kate) A better qualifying yesterday
gets us in the thick of things.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.198
P10, P15. (inhales sharply)

01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:29.919
So we're gonna go for a two stop.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.598
Medium-hard-medium, that's plan A.
Final stint, we go hards for plan B.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.879
So, on this,
do you have any track concerns?

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.880
Don't look at me. Look at him.

01:06:40.599 --> 01:06:41.800
It's good for JP.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.280
Start me on hards.

01:06:44.119 --> 01:06:46.718
Nah, the track's cooled down.
You won't have any grip.

01:06:46.719 --> 01:06:48.039
That's right.

01:06:48.679 --> 01:06:51.320
For three weeks,
all the talk's been how reckless I am.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.359
Everyone's wondering
if I'm gonna drive 'em off track,

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.800
which means no one's
gonna be watching out for him.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.239
Today, you win us this race.

01:07:09.239 --> 01:07:12.439
(Croft) Twenty laps down here at Monza,
and the pack have been split.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.118
The leaders are pulling away,
led by Max Verstappen,

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:17.558
with Joshua Pearce back in P10.

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:20.238
(Brundle) Meanwhile, Sonny Hayes
is holding up the rest of the pack,

01:07:20.239 --> 01:07:22.559
stuck behind him in a DRS train.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.999
(Croft) Pearce looks to be in
a great position to finish in the top ten,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.880
and maybe even a run to the podium.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.959
(Brundle) But there's still a long way
to go in this race,

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.840
and with rain potentially forecast,
anything can happen.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.718
Tires are gone. Coming in.

01:07:39.719 --> 01:07:41.079
Yeah, copy. Box. Box.

01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:44.038
(Croft) Apex GP is prepping
a fresh set of tires for Hayes.

01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:47.719
That's gonna bring in
all the other teams to avoid the undercut.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.319
Uh, changed my mind.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.799
(Croft) But, no! He's staying out,
with the cars behind him all scrambling

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.158
to get on fresh tires that apparently
he doesn't think he needs anymore.

01:07:57.159 --> 01:07:59.638
Should we just do the opposite
of what he tells us to do?

01:07:59.639 --> 01:08:01.599
Stand by till I lose my tires.

01:08:02.599 --> 01:08:05.559
- I thought he had lost his tires.
- (stammers) I think he means literally.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.319
Puncture, left rear. Coming in.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.279
(Croft) And there goes Hayes's tires.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.678
(Brundle) That's quite a mess,
gravel on the track.

01:08:14.679 --> 01:08:17.999
That will bring out the virtual safety car
for a quick sweep.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.478
(Croft) So the race gets neutralized.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:23.118
Everyone slows down
to 40% of their racing speed,

01:08:23.119 --> 01:08:25.118
and all the race strategies
will get a reset.

01:08:25.119 --> 01:08:28.118
(Brundle) And that is why this is
the perfect time to take a pit stop.

01:08:28.119 --> 01:08:29.519
While you're in the pit lane,

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.519
your opponents
are restricted to a much slower pace

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.198
and you're not going to lose
as much track position when you rejoin.

01:08:35.199 --> 01:08:38.398
- I take it I'm staying out, right?
- Copy. Joshua, stay out. Stay out.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:41.038
- We want you out to gain track position.
- Copy.

01:08:41.039 --> 01:08:43.039
Up is down, down is up.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.839
(Croft) Sonny Hayes hesitated
before he left his pit box,

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.639
and he's come out just in front
of Max Verstappen.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.919
(Max) That was naughty.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.118
(Brundle) Hayes has slowed a bit
in the pit lane,

01:08:59.119 --> 01:09:02.999
which will cost the Red Bull
and the two Ferraris precious time.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.238
Push, Joshua. Push.

01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:05.799
You are now P4. P4.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.999
(Croft) Who's coming up from behind?
Here he is, Joshua Pearce.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.799
- Let's see! Let's go!
- Yes!

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.438
- This is all playing into his hands...
- Wow.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.799
...at the moment.
Could be a dream afternoon.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.639
But can Hayes hold Verstappen
for a little bit longer?

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.639
Verstappen tries into turn one,
nothing doing there.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.398
Gets the better exit.
Through the Curva Grande we go.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.639
- Damn, he's good.
- Verstappen's trying to get past.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.599
(Brundle) Sonny Hayes
looking carefully in his mirrors.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.839
He must let Max Verstappen through.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.478
Yeah, I deserved that.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:34.759
(Brundle) And Max shows his disapproval,

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.358
and I don't blame him, as they head down
towards the second chicane.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:40.959
(Croft)
And through goes Joshua Pearce in P4,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.559
now much closer to the front of the pack.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.600
(thunder rumbles)

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:49.038
(Brundle) Just seven laps to go,
and here comes the rain.

01:09:49.039 --> 01:09:52.118
(Croft) Let's see who plays it safe
with a switch to the intermediate tire,

01:09:52.119 --> 01:09:54.640
and who might gamble
to stay out on slicks.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.519
It's getting tricky out here, guys.
What's the plan?

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.358
You're running P4. We think P2 and P3
are switching to inters for safety,

01:10:06.359 --> 01:10:08.078
and it looks like P1 is staying out.

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:09.880
- What do you wanna do?
- What's Sonny gonna do?

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.038
Take a wild guess.

01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:13.520
- (Joshua) I'm staying out.
- Copy that.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.879
(Brundle) And the two Ferraris
come in for intermediate tires.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.238
Let's see who else
decides to play it safe.

01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:24.079
(Croft) And as George Russell pits,
Joshua Pearce moves into P2.

01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:25.679
(cheering)

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.118
Sonny, Joshua is staying out on slicks.
If he can hold on and find a dry line,

01:10:28.119 --> 01:10:29.238
he's gonna finish second.

01:10:29.239 --> 01:10:30.319
Second's not enough.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.720
Damn it.

01:10:33.239 --> 01:10:34.879
Okay, coming in for inters.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.479
- Inters, inters.
- Let's go! He's coming in!

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.000
- How far behind me are they?
- Thirty seconds.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.318
Oh, my God.
He's gonna take out Verstappen.

01:10:48.319 --> 01:10:50.078
Let me know
when they hit the main straight.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:53.438
Don't tell him! They penalize both cars.
They will take the win away.

01:10:53.439 --> 01:10:54.479
Just trust me, will ya?

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.799
I'm pushing but I can't catch him.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.799
(Brundle) As the race leaders
approach the main straight,

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.038
Sonny Hayes is in another standoff
over team strategy.

01:11:04.039 --> 01:11:05.520
- Now.
- No!

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.278
(Croft) Finally,
Hayes back out onto the track,

01:11:09.279 --> 01:11:11.038
and just in front of Verstappen.

01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:14.038
Now he'll get a blue flag here
so Verstappen can get past,

01:11:14.039 --> 01:11:18.358
but until then, the Dutch driver
is caught up in Hayes's dirty air.

01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:20.278
(Brundle) With every turn he hangs on,

01:11:20.279 --> 01:11:22.759
he slows Verstappen
a fraction of a second,

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.118
providing Joshua Pearce
one last chance to catch up.

01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:27.359
I can see him. I'm almost there.

01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:30.158
Tell JP to follow me.

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:34.079
- Copy. Uh, Joshua, Sonny is your tow.
- I'm right behind him.

01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:36.759
(Croft) Verstappen pulls away then.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.519
But now, onto the rear wing
of his teammate's car

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.879
comes Joshua Pearce.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.278
(Brundle) Pearce picks up
the slipstream from Hayes,

01:11:43.279 --> 01:11:46.319
gaining time,
but driving blind in the spray.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.920
Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me now.

01:11:57.239 --> 01:11:58.358
Pass. Pass.

01:11:58.359 --> 01:11:59.839
- Overtake him. Overtake.
- Copy.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:04.478
(Croft) He's been gaining, and boom!
Joshua Pearce slingshots past Sonny Hayes,

01:12:04.479 --> 01:12:07.519
- and now is in striking distance of P1.
- (cheering)

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.959
Tell JP to wait for the straight
into turn one.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.358
Be patient.

01:12:11.359 --> 01:12:13.478
- Straight at turn one.
- (crew member) Copy.

01:12:13.479 --> 01:12:17.640
Joshua, Sonny says wait for the straight.
The straight into turn one.

01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:20.799
(Joshua) I'm right there.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.039
I've got him.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.198
(Brundle) Pearce is right on the gearbox
of Verstappen,

01:12:25.199 --> 01:12:27.999
down the back straight
at over 200 miles an hour.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.439
I see an opening. Going for it.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.039
(Brundle) The rookie attacks in 11.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.479
No, no!

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.519
(Croft)
Pearce pulls alongside the Red Bull,

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.198
he's wheels ahead,
for the first time ever...

01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:42.078
Apex GP... Oh, no!

01:12:42.079 --> 01:12:43.520
No!

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.880
- (sad music playing)
- (no audible dialogue)

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.439
(monitor beeping)

01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:09.640
(reporter speaking Italian on television)

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.640
(sighs)

01:14:15.479 --> 01:14:17.319
(sighs, in English) For God's sake.

01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:28.759
- (Ruben) Bernadette, how's he doing?
- (Bernadette grunts)

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.038
He's stable.

01:14:30.039 --> 01:14:31.720
He's resting now.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.359
(exhales heavily, mutters)

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.478
Very happy to hear it.

01:14:36.479 --> 01:14:38.959
I'm so sorry for what happened.
It was clearly--

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.119
Sonny, over here, please.

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:48.840
(sighing)

01:14:55.039 --> 01:14:57.759
Um, I just wanna say I've been--

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.359
Joshua says you're an asshole.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.318
Yeah, that tracks.

01:15:03.319 --> 01:15:05.680
I think you're a dangerous asshole.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.078
- Ms. Pearce--
- You're part of the same team, right?

01:15:10.079 --> 01:15:11.318
Looking out for each other.

01:15:11.319 --> 01:15:13.999
Except you had him
doing something so dangerous

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.159
it almost got him killed.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.479
- Okay, listen--
- No, you listen to me.

01:15:21.279 --> 01:15:23.119
This is my son.

01:15:24.199 --> 01:15:26.358
And if anything...
anything else happens to him,

01:15:26.359 --> 01:15:27.719
I'm coming after you.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.278
And you better pray I don't put you
in a bed next to Joshua

01:15:30.279 --> 01:15:32.319
for a very, very long time.

01:15:33.039 --> 01:15:34.000
Clear?

01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:37.640
Sure.

01:15:41.479 --> 01:15:42.920
(sighs)

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.560
(reporters murmuring, clamoring)

01:15:54.359 --> 01:15:55.438
Sonny, Sonny.

01:15:55.439 --> 01:15:58.279
Do you think Joshua blames you
for what happened in Monza?

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.679
- (reporters clamoring)
- (reporter) Sonny, come on.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.959
It was clear
that you were running his race.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.438
Look, you kept him out on slick tires,
in dangerous conditions,

01:16:10.439 --> 01:16:14.038
that even if you told him not to pass,
wasn't the accident inevitable?

01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:16.078
- If I may. If I may.
- (reporters clamoring)

01:16:16.079 --> 01:16:18.118
Joshua's back home, recovering.

01:16:18.119 --> 01:16:20.278
We are expecting his return
in a few weeks.

01:16:20.279 --> 01:16:25.959
Until that moment, our reserve driver,
Luca Cortez right there, will drive and...

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.520
- Next man up.
- (clamoring) Answer the question!

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.759
(Buxton) A chaotic week
for Expensify Apex GP,

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.599
and again, it's Sonny Hayes at the center.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.198
Many are blaming him for his teammate's
horrific accident at Monza.

01:16:40.199 --> 01:16:44.599
His high-stakes, gambling style of racing
has the whole grid on edge,

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.358
and while the controversy continues
over who was to blame,

01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:51.799
doctors have said that Pearce
will miss the next three races,

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.039
due to the burns suffered on his hands
as he begins his road to recovery.

01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:05.520
(Kate) Today, we're going
with our combat upgrade.

01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:09.438
The revised shapes will improve
the flow field under the floor,

01:17:09.439 --> 01:17:13.238
allowing us to run in dirty air
with minimal loss of performance.

01:17:13.239 --> 01:17:15.920
Means we have to keep the field close
at all times,

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:19.600
and as for this week's plan C...

01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:28.959
They've docked us to the back of the grid
'cause they don't like the way we drive.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.920
Fine. Fuck 'em.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.879
'Cause if we can pick up
a tenth of a second from you,

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.478
and from you, and you, and me...

01:17:38.479 --> 01:17:41.158
If everyone in this room
can make one critical contribution,

01:17:41.159 --> 01:17:42.479
that's a second every lap.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:47.520
And after 72 laps, that's the difference
between last and first.

01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:50.560
Plan C...

01:17:52.119 --> 01:17:53.720
Plan C's for combat.

01:17:56.119 --> 01:18:00.759
Combat, combat, combat.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:06.318
(crew chanting) Combat, combat,
combat, combat.

01:18:06.319 --> 01:18:07.959
(chanting continues)

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.158
(driving electronic song playing)

01:18:09.159 --> 01:18:13.078
I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna lose myself

01:18:13.079 --> 01:18:17.278
Tell me if I crossed a line
I ain't trying to hurt myself

01:18:17.279 --> 01:18:22.278
Didn't want to call your name
Only got myself to blame

01:18:22.279 --> 01:18:23.959
Oh, yeah

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.119
In my world, in my mind
Always running out of time

01:18:26.239 --> 01:18:27.238
(crowd cheering)

01:18:27.239 --> 01:18:29.318
(Croft) And that's Hayes
in the upgraded Apex.

01:18:29.319 --> 01:18:32.599
Now the team were penalized
back to last place after Monza,

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.759
but here he is, coming from the cellar,
passing his new teammate, Luca Cortez.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.118
...still I wait for you

01:18:39.119 --> 01:18:40.639
(vocalizes)

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.118
Yeah, it feels...

01:18:42.119 --> 01:18:44.959
(Croft) Round the banking,
Hayes has got past Ocon.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.639
This is brilliant last lap drama.
What a fantastic finish.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.159
(laughs)

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.358
(exclaims, chuckles)

01:18:53.359 --> 01:18:58.158
Ain't no way to tell
Which way it's gonna go

01:18:58.159 --> 01:19:01.559
But it feels

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.358
So good I might just lose my mind

01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:09.439
No question if it's wrong or right

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.520
And now it's too late
No way to take it slow

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.999
(Brundle) Another fearless attack
from Hayes.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.799
And here's where the Apex GP
has found strength.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.920
Three-tenths gained every lap,
and in the corners alone.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.759
I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna lose myself

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.559
(Croft) Scrapping away on the last lap,

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.759
Sonny Hayes gets the inside line,
but he can't quite get past.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.358
George Russell will hang on here
for sixth place,

01:19:43.359 --> 01:19:46.599
but this is Apex GP's best ever finish.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.919
- It's a valiant seventh.
- Combat, I love it!

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.839
(crowd cheering)

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.560
(manager) Every race you miss,
fans just forget you.

01:19:55.279 --> 01:19:57.439
Sonny always seems to be one step ahead.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.278
You never know.
Sonny may be a saboteur, Josh.

01:20:02.279 --> 01:20:03.398
He may be a saboteur.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:05.118
- (crowd cheering)
- (song continues)

01:20:05.119 --> 01:20:08.158
Yeah it feels

01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:12.358
So good I might just lose my mind

01:20:12.359 --> 01:20:14.919
No question if it's wrong or right

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.398
(Croft) ...and they go wheel to wheel,
Verstappen and Leclerc.

01:20:17.399 --> 01:20:20.559
Verstappen will have the inside.
Perez goes round the outside.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.879
Perez makes contact with Charles Leclerc

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.239
as Sonny Hayes threads that Apex GP car
through the midfield.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.078
Yeah

01:20:39.079 --> 01:20:40.919
Bounce back
When the bottles is on me

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.198
I'm pushin' a new pen
Rewriting the story

01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:45.198
Hello to my old ways
Goodbye to the nosebleeds

01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:47.879
You fighting to stay here
You probably OD'ing

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.959
Ain't finna pop for no reason

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.799
I don't throw shots, I run legions

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.438
I been goin' over the top
Where no queen been

01:20:53.439 --> 01:20:55.358
Die with no regrets
This is my season

01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:57.038
(Croft) Talk about leaving it late.

01:20:57.039 --> 01:21:00.839
Hayes squeezes through on the inside,
and with a run to the line now,

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.719
for their best position ever, P5.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.639
(Brundle) Give the design team a bonus,

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.278
because the upgrade
has completely changed this car.

01:21:08.279 --> 01:21:10.438
(Croft) And if Joshua Pearce is watching,

01:21:10.439 --> 01:21:13.318
well, he must be thinking,
"What might have been?"

01:21:13.319 --> 01:21:15.198
Yeah, it feels

01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:18.599
So good I might just lose my mind

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.639
He's treating you like a pawn, Josh.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.239
- Be a knight! Be a knight! Be a knight!
- (bicycle bell ringing)

01:21:28.079 --> 01:21:29.879
(Croft)
Who would have believed this weeks ago?

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.759
Expensify Apex GP
has the racing world on notice.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.639
(crowd chanting) Apex! Apex! Apex!

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:39.039
(chanting continues)

01:21:41.119 --> 01:21:46.398
(Brundle) Someone call the 1990s.
Sonny Hayes, if you missed him, he's back.

01:21:46.399 --> 01:21:48.560
(song ends)

01:21:53.239 --> 01:21:55.720
Last one up buys breakfast. (chuckles)

01:21:56.399 --> 01:21:58.840
(indistinct chattering)

01:22:03.439 --> 01:22:04.479
Look who's back.

01:22:05.319 --> 01:22:09.399
(crew cheering, applauding)

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.840
Hello.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.159
Good to have you back, JP. We missed you.

01:22:21.319 --> 01:22:23.239
(dramatic rap song playing)

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:35.438
This for the underdogs
This for the underdogs, underdogs

01:22:35.439 --> 01:22:39.158
Slide out the garage
I got a hundred cars

01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:41.238
This for the underdogs

01:22:41.239 --> 01:22:43.238
The teller just ask me
How I want the cashy

01:22:43.239 --> 01:22:44.759
(crowd chanting) Apex! Apex! Apex! Apex!

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.318
I told 'em a hundred large

01:22:46.319 --> 01:22:49.000
I want them gold wraps
Put it up double R

01:22:50.079 --> 01:22:53.398
Tell 'em get out the way
4x4 big Phantom, supe

01:22:53.399 --> 01:22:56.760
They thought I was canceled
I piped up and flipped the channel

01:23:03.159 --> 01:23:05.719
(Croft) It's lights out and away we go!

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.238
And it's a decent start,

01:23:07.239 --> 01:23:10.158
and everyone keeping it clean
as into La Source we go.

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:11.679
Ferrari ahead of Red Bull,

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.478
but here the two Apex GP cars
looking to work together as a team.

01:23:16.479 --> 01:23:20.118
It's a welcome back to the track
for Joshua Pearce,

01:23:20.119 --> 01:23:21.759
and Sonny Hayes glad to see him,

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.318
as they slice their way
through positions four and five.

01:23:25.319 --> 01:23:27.279
And onto the Kemmel Straight we go.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:32.238
Now approaching top speed,
Sonny Hayes ahead of Joshua Pearce.

01:23:32.239 --> 01:23:35.679
He's showing no ill effects
from that time off after the crash.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.158
The car's working beautifully.
They're working as a team.

01:23:39.159 --> 01:23:42.920
But hang on, Pearce right on his tail,
using the slipstream.

01:23:43.039 --> 01:23:45.238
Is he about to try and overtake?

01:23:45.239 --> 01:23:47.959
Into the chicane we go
and they touch wheels!

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.879
- This is disaster for Apex...
- (exclaiming)

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.560
...as out goes Sonny Hayes
and into the gravel!

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.199
Assholes! (grunts)

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.198
(Brundle)
What is happening with this team?

01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:03.359
Their first race back together,
and they've run into each other.

01:24:05.399 --> 01:24:06.398
- You did great, Joshua.
- Well done, mate.

01:24:06.399 --> 01:24:07.839
(laughs)

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.079
Whoo! (grunts)

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.839
You pull that shit again,
I will knock your teeth out.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.599
Oh, no one gets past us
without a fight, right?

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.679
Oh, is this funny?
You think you got a seat next year?

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.719
'Cause you just cut your chances in half.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.078
- That's how dumb you are.
- You failed. You failed!

01:24:20.079 --> 01:24:21.800
- Why should I listen to you anyway, man?
- Hey.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.839
(exhales heavily)

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.438
Look, man.
I don't give two shits about you.

01:24:26.439 --> 01:24:28.679
You wanna sabotage your career,
you go right ahead.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.999
I've seen hundreds of guys
with your talent come and go.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.479
No one cares!

01:24:33.319 --> 01:24:36.840
But you sabotage Ruben, who backed you?
You sabotage his team?

01:24:38.199 --> 01:24:39.319
I won't let you do it.

01:24:44.319 --> 01:24:47.679
- Thanks, coach. (laughs)
- Get your shit together!

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.319
So stupid! God...

01:24:58.119 --> 01:24:59.519
(interviewer)
How would you sum up your race today?

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.358
Ooh. Um, it was good.

01:25:02.359 --> 01:25:05.479
You know, the car feels great.
I think the team's done an amazing job.

01:25:06.159 --> 01:25:08.159
It's just a shame
about the contact with Sonny.

01:25:09.199 --> 01:25:10.439
You hate to see that happen.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.520
(pants)

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.680
(sighs)

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.559
- (Joshua) Hey, how are you doing?
- (host) Hi, how are you?

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.039
Good. Sensational.

01:25:42.319 --> 01:25:44.279
- Where's the team?
- Right this way, gentlemen.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.079
(sighs)

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.399
Brilliant, you made it. Come on. Sit down.

01:25:59.479 --> 01:26:01.158
Sonny, you know Joshua.

01:26:01.159 --> 01:26:03.000
Joshua, Sonny.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.398
So I'm sure you both
have heard the rumors. (sighs)

01:26:05.399 --> 01:26:08.318
We all lose our jobs
if you can't pull off a miracle,

01:26:08.319 --> 01:26:10.358
and that's starting with
staying on the bloody track.

01:26:10.359 --> 01:26:12.398
Well, we were doing just fine
while JP was out.

01:26:12.399 --> 01:26:13.759
I was out because I was listening to you.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.198
- Ish.
- And please don't call me JP.

01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:16.759
It's a nickname. You don't get to choose.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.078
And your name doesn't even make sense.
Is it Sonny, is it Hayesie?

01:26:19.079 --> 01:26:20.198
- We don't know, do we, Kate?
- (scoffs)

01:26:20.199 --> 01:26:21.239
- (chuckles)
- (Kate) Lads.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.000
Have I not delivered you a car?

01:26:26.039 --> 01:26:27.919
So you can do one thing for me.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.159
Cards.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.560
Come on. I know you have 'em with ya.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.398
It's my team meeting,
we're gonna do it my way.

01:26:34.399 --> 01:26:36.278
- We're playing poker.
- (Joshua scoffs) Come on.

01:26:36.279 --> 01:26:38.959
Yeah. Whoever wins gets to be
our number one driver tomorrow,

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.920
and if I win, I get to choose.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.759
- Didn't he gamble for a living?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.158
Now he's living in a van.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.439
(chuckles)

01:26:48.119 --> 01:26:49.079
Texas Hold'em?

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.239
("Just Cool" playing)

01:26:57.359 --> 01:26:59.359
(Sonny speaks indistinctly)

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.078
So, Sonny here likes straight talk.

01:27:05.079 --> 01:27:06.679
- (chuckles)
- Isn't that right, Sonny?

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.919
- (Sonny) Yeah, that's what I hear.
- (Kate) So, let's talk.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.038
Who wants to go first?

01:27:10.039 --> 01:27:11.759
- I'll go first.
- I'll go first.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.358
No, I'll go first.

01:27:13.359 --> 01:27:16.639
What's the difference between
Joshua Pearce and Sonny Hayes?

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.679
A lot of decades.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.959
- Hard-won experience.
- Of living in a van?

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.198
Total freedom.

01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:22.279
Total failure.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.559
Says the guy who still lives with his mom.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.999
Says the guy with two pair.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.880
- Says the guy with trips.
- Says the guy with a full house.

01:27:31.039 --> 01:27:32.759
- Girl.
- (Joshua scoffs)

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.519
Wait, I don't even live with my mum.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.560
Okay.

01:27:36.119 --> 01:27:37.559
She just cooks for me sometimes.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.840
Mm-hmm.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.318
If you'd any constructive criticism
for each other, what would it be?

01:27:43.319 --> 01:27:45.039
- Don't be such an arsehole.
- Don't be such a dickhead.

01:27:47.039 --> 01:27:47.999
That was constructive.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.239
(scoffs)

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.159
You have a deficient frontal cortex.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.599
- A what?
- You can't analyze risk.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.919
It's not all your fault.
It's not fully formed yet at your age.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.519
But come the day you learn patience,

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.600
- and stop being so immature, thinking--
- Patience.

01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:05.600
- Patience is good.
- (Sonny) Patience.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.760
Joshua.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.238
He doesn't care about
what anyone else has to say but himself.

01:28:11.239 --> 01:28:14.519
He just comes in and imposes his will
on all of us with no discussion.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.118
He doesn't listen.
I'm trying, but he doesn't listen.

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:18.199
Mmm.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.038
- Sonny?
- What?

01:28:21.039 --> 01:28:22.520
(Joshua scoffs)

01:28:23.319 --> 01:28:25.959
(sighs) Wow. (scoffs)

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.879
(sighs)

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.559
Why they lie to the people?
Why the world is so evil?

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.719
(no audible dialogue)

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.399
Why cant just cool?
Just let me cool

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.600
Walking explosives
Stressing all of the time

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.919
Who taught you how to play?

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.760
My dad liked to gamble.

01:28:42.319 --> 01:28:44.639
- He make big bets too?
- Put a big one on me.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.479
How old were you when your fathers died?

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.799
Sorry.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.079
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.119
Huh.

01:28:58.119 --> 01:28:59.278
Why do you race?

01:28:59.279 --> 01:29:03.158
Money... (sighs)
...fame and free clothes. (chuckles)

01:29:03.159 --> 01:29:05.358
Oh, my God, with the phone.
Put the thing down, will ya?

01:29:05.359 --> 01:29:07.158
What do you care what they say?

01:29:07.159 --> 01:29:08.959
Easy for you to say. They all love you.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.239
It's just noise, man.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.198
Drive the car.

01:29:13.199 --> 01:29:14.520
You're really good at it.

01:29:17.359 --> 01:29:18.600
You might be great.

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:38.158
Hyperbolic catastrophic scatterbrain

01:29:38.159 --> 01:29:42.118
This is one diabolic catatonic parade

01:29:42.119 --> 01:29:44.559
Everyone just go away
There's nothing new to celebrate

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.800
(Kate exhales heavily)

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.839
There's nowhere left to run away

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:51.679
They're closing off the open seas
They're locking off the runways

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:55.879
They keep telling me the one thing
So far from everything I see

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.238
Just go away

01:29:57.239 --> 01:29:59.519
(groans) Yeah. (chuckles)

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.599
Look at that, huh?
Number one driver tomorrow.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.118
- Bonding?
- (Joshua) Ooh.

01:30:04.119 --> 01:30:05.158
Well, this is nice.

01:30:05.159 --> 01:30:07.158
We gotta go, mate. Sponsor party at OMNIA.

01:30:07.159 --> 01:30:08.359
Gotta steal ya.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.759
Uh, Uncle Sonny,
you're welcome to come with--

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.359
Thank you, I'm good.
I have a race tomorrow.

01:30:13.039 --> 01:30:15.880
- Cool. Kate?
- No, thank you.

01:30:16.439 --> 01:30:18.078
- (manager) Come on.
- Thanks for this, Kate.

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:21.118
(manager) Come on, boy.
Uh... Uh, girls, you might have to...

01:30:21.119 --> 01:30:23.078
We're gonna go dancing.
Should we go dancing?

01:30:23.079 --> 01:30:24.960
- Yeah!
- (all clamoring)

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.479
(romantic pop song playing on speakers)

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.760
Listen,

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.920
let's get this straight, okay?

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.919
I don't mess around during the season,
and never with a member of my team,

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.640
and what I'm attracted to is winning.

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:48.039
And you just lost to a pair of fives.

01:31:00.359 --> 01:31:05.438
So, baby, let's get messy
Let's get all the way undone

01:31:05.439 --> 01:31:10.198
Come over, undress me
Just like I've never been touched

01:31:10.199 --> 01:31:13.959
Baby, I'm obsessed with you
And there's no replica

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.038
Baby, let's get messy
Let's get all the way undone

01:31:17.039 --> 01:31:18.560
(song continues as club remix)

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.439
(energetic pop song plays)

01:31:35.159 --> 01:31:38.919
I wanna let my hair down
While I'm staring down your face

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:42.278
Wanna go till lights out
Take you right back to my place

01:31:42.279 --> 01:31:45.519
You out your mind
If you don't know what this is

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.560
Hey.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.119
You're a driver, aren't you?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.478
- Yeah.
- Which team?

01:31:51.479 --> 01:31:52.759
Apex GP.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.279
Can you introduce me to Carlos Sainz?

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.839
I'll go get him.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.879
Move from the back

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.799
Eyes on me
How you like that

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.520
Just like this
Here for the night

01:32:03.439 --> 01:32:05.198
Oh, hey. Hey.

01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:08.038
Oi, why do they say this place is weird?
I like this, bruv.

01:32:08.039 --> 01:32:10.318
Glad you're having fun, man.
Be safe. I'm gonna leave, yeah?

01:32:10.319 --> 01:32:11.599
- Huh?
- I said I'm gonna cut.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.238
- Oh, wait, no, no, no. You just got here!
- I just... I'm not feeling it.

01:32:14.239 --> 01:32:16.920
What do you mean?
We just got here, bruv. Josh!

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.279
Just keep watching

01:32:21.279 --> 01:32:23.560
(car engine whirring)

01:32:39.079 --> 01:32:41.760
- (tires screech)
- (thuds)

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.919
(screaming)

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:48.039
(gasps, panting)

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:50.960
(sighs)

01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:13.319
Hey.

01:33:15.359 --> 01:33:17.199
- (chuckles)
- (groans)

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.119
I shouldn't drink tequila.

01:33:23.479 --> 01:33:24.839
Last night was Ruben's idea?

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.520
(stammers) Yeah, the first part.

01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:30.039
- Well... (stammers, chuckles)
- Not the second! (chuckles)

01:33:40.039 --> 01:33:41.039
Come on.

01:33:42.159 --> 01:33:44.079
Why are you here, Sonny, huh?

01:33:47.199 --> 01:33:49.039
Not much of a story.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.560
Okay.

01:33:57.319 --> 01:33:59.159
I'm here to prove everyone wrong.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.560
My ex, my old boss,

01:34:05.199 --> 01:34:07.118
my first-year uni physics professor--

01:34:07.119 --> 01:34:08.679
- That bastard.
- Yeah.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.720
(chuckles)

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.079
And until we win, I haven't.

01:34:14.239 --> 01:34:18.318
So, unfortunately, I now rely on you.

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:19.399
Mmm.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.479
I was gonna be world champion.

01:34:28.039 --> 01:34:29.479
The best there ever was.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.198
I'm just a kid and I'm on the track
with my idols,

01:34:33.199 --> 01:34:35.398
Senna, Mansell, Prost.

01:34:35.399 --> 01:34:37.000
And I am quick.

01:34:38.359 --> 01:34:39.760
I'm fearless.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.760
I was next.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.600
And then...

01:34:48.039 --> 01:34:49.000
(clicks fingers)

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.359
...it was all taken away.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.920
The crash, huh?

01:34:56.439 --> 01:35:00.079
So I lost my seat, my money,
my sanity, my...

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.239
myself, really.

01:35:03.159 --> 01:35:08.038
Just became this angry,
resentful shithead.

01:35:08.039 --> 01:35:11.640
(chuckles)
Not someone I'm particularly proud of.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.038
Till one day,
I realized what I had really lost,

01:35:18.039 --> 01:35:22.959
and it wasn't the titles,
or the trophies, or the records.

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.239
It was my love for racing.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.399
So I started driving.

01:35:31.359 --> 01:35:34.759
Didn't matter the car, the circuit,
didn't need anyone to watch.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.560
Just as long as I was behind the wheel,
I was good.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.039
Sometimes...

01:35:49.199 --> 01:35:50.640
(sighs)

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.680
What? Come on.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:03.158
It's rare, but sometimes,
there's this moment in the car

01:36:03.159 --> 01:36:05.760
where everything goes quiet,

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.159
my heartbeat slows,

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.920
it's peaceful,

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.479
and I can see everything, and no one...

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.560
no one can touch me.

01:36:19.479 --> 01:36:22.319
And I am chasing that moment
every time I get in the car.

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:29.720
I don't know when I'll find it again,
but, man, I want to.

01:36:30.479 --> 01:36:31.880
(chuckles) I want to.

01:36:33.319 --> 01:36:36.399
'Cause in that moment, I'm flying.

01:36:47.439 --> 01:36:50.560
(doorbell rings)

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.560
Kate.

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:00.839
- Ruben.
- Where is he?

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.000
Where's who?

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.239
What are you talking about?

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.279
Ruben, seriously?

01:37:08.199 --> 01:37:10.599
(scoffs) One, how dare you?

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.279
Two, I respect professional boundaries.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:14.960
And three...

01:37:17.239 --> 01:37:18.759
Three, yeah, he's on... he's on the balcony.

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:19.800
(grunts)

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.519
- Well, you're up early.
- (Ruben) Get dressed.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.760
- Yeah, what's going on?
- They're coming for our car.

01:37:29.199 --> 01:37:32.118
(race director) It's my duty to inform you
that we've received an anonymous tip

01:37:32.119 --> 01:37:34.279
that your upgraded floor is in violation.

01:37:34.399 --> 01:37:35.519
(Ruben) From who?

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.198
- I can't say.
- Ah. (chuckles)

01:37:37.199 --> 01:37:39.919
Sir, we submitted the drawings long ago.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.959
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.158
And you approved them all.

01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:46.599
It's whether the parts you're racing with
were developed outside of your facility.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.959
What? That's insane.

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.600
Based on the paperwork we've received,
there are concerns.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.038
Hang on, where'd you get these?
These are internal documents.

01:37:53.039 --> 01:37:55.519
(Ruben) This team
doesn't break any rules, sir. No, no.

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.438
- I'll take that with a pinch of salt.
- Someone can fabricate documents.

01:37:58.439 --> 01:37:59.759
Your car's under review.

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.879
- You know the procedure.
- What?

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:05.158
You cannot race unless you substitute
the previously approved components.

01:38:05.159 --> 01:38:07.278
- No!
- Do you mean our old design?

01:38:07.279 --> 01:38:08.438
A shit box!

01:38:08.439 --> 01:38:09.679
(in Spanish) No lo puedo creer.

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.679
(in English) Where were you
the last two years? Why now?

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.038
Because we might actually win a race?
Is that it?

01:38:14.039 --> 01:38:16.959
This is not car racing, sir,
this is like corporate espionage!

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.999
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come... Come here.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.839
I'm talking to you! Sir!

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.680
Without the upgrade, we're screwed.

01:38:48.199 --> 01:38:51.478
(Kaspar) Sonny, let it go.
Focus on a clean start.

01:38:51.479 --> 01:38:53.279
We'll never win clean.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.278
Can we just not break any rules?

01:38:55.279 --> 01:38:57.840
Yeah, the rules are always
against us though, aren't they?

01:39:01.199 --> 01:39:03.398
Get them safe through lap one. (sighs)

01:39:03.399 --> 01:39:06.278
(Hugh) Sonny, we just need
to keep it in one piece. Okay?

01:39:06.279 --> 01:39:08.999
(Sonny breathing shakily)

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.438
(tense music playing)

01:39:11.439 --> 01:39:12.720
Sonny?

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.880
(tires squeal)

01:39:36.199 --> 01:39:38.799
- Oi, what the hell?
- I don't know!

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.879
(Joshua) What's wrong with Sonny?

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.158
Joshua, yep. Keep focused.
You're still good.

01:39:42.159 --> 01:39:43.239
What's he doing?

01:39:49.479 --> 01:39:50.800
He's driving angry.

01:39:51.439 --> 01:39:52.720
Not good. It's not good.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.358
Sonny, we need to make these tires last.

01:40:01.359 --> 01:40:02.800
Take it easy.

01:40:09.399 --> 01:40:11.559
No, he's put the car in qualifying mode.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.759
He's gonna run the battery down.
Tell him to put it back.

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.600
(Hugh) Sonny, you're in qualifying mode.
What's going on?

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.840
Sonny, what's happening?

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:31.759
(Croft) ...blasting along
Las Vegas Boulevard, 210 miles an hour.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.198
Hard on the brakes now,
and into the chicane.

01:40:34.199 --> 01:40:38.600
Sergio Perez, ahead of Sonny Hayes,
but that's a mega exit from Hayes.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.679
He's gotta gain on Sergio Perez,
and he's closing.

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:44.358
Meter by meter. Inch by inch.

01:40:44.359 --> 01:40:48.960
Is this the place to take a gamble?
Hayes attacks round the outside.

01:40:54.399 --> 01:40:56.319
(crowd gasping, clamoring)

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.800
No! No!

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.920
(somber orchestral music playing)

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:24.520
Why do we do this?

01:41:25.119 --> 01:41:27.799
What's wrong with tennis, huh?

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.398
- Or golf.
- (chuckles)

01:41:29.399 --> 01:41:31.079
(chuckles) Right?

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.479
(exhales heavily)

01:41:34.279 --> 01:41:35.239
Christ.

01:41:37.119 --> 01:41:38.560
We are totally insane.

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.479
(sighs)

01:41:43.359 --> 01:41:45.479
"C5 neck fracture.

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.159
Spinal contusion.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.600
Compressed thoracic vertebrae.

01:41:51.159 --> 01:41:55.238
Further blunt force impact trauma
likely to result in vision loss,

01:41:55.239 --> 01:41:57.039
paralysis, death."

01:42:00.159 --> 01:42:01.880
Really lead with the good news,
don't they?

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.239
This is a report from 30 years ago.

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.199
Why didn't you tell me?

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.279
You never should have raced again, Sonny.

01:42:13.399 --> 01:42:15.840
How... How do you think I'd feel
if you die on the track?

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.959
Revenge for Monaco.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.520
(stammers) It's not a joke!

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.479
It's me who's liable, Sonny.

01:42:26.239 --> 01:42:29.000
And don't think there's some
bullshit loophole to get you out of this.

01:42:29.119 --> 01:42:30.478
- No.
- Ruben, we're drivers.

01:42:30.479 --> 01:42:33.159
We are not drivers, not anymore.
I'm sorry. We're not.

01:42:35.079 --> 01:42:36.319
We're losers.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.279
We're a pair of dumb,

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.199
sentimental,

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.760
broke losers.

01:42:47.479 --> 01:42:48.520
(sighs)

01:42:49.279 --> 01:42:50.640
Okay. You're off the team.

01:42:55.359 --> 01:42:58.960
(sighs) Your van is in the garage
with all your stuff in it, and...

01:43:03.319 --> 01:43:04.399
(chuckles)

01:43:05.239 --> 01:43:07.640
I never should have pulled you
into this, Sonny.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.039
I'm sorry.

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.640
Ruben, wait!

01:43:15.079 --> 01:43:16.199
(sighs)

01:43:19.119 --> 01:43:20.199
I need this.

01:43:21.359 --> 01:43:22.319
(sighs)

01:43:23.039 --> 01:43:27.239
No one drives forever, Sonny.
Not even you.

01:43:41.199 --> 01:43:46.880
Pippa, load up Monza.
Just like it happened. In the rain.

01:43:48.039 --> 01:43:50.278
(crew member) Joshua,
Sonny says wait for the straight,

01:43:50.279 --> 01:43:52.239
the straight into turn one.

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.960
Run it again, please.

01:44:05.279 --> 01:44:08.119
(crew member) ...wait for the straight,
the straight into turn one.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.399
Run it again, please.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.640
(crew member) The straight into turn one.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.640
(exclaims) Whoo! (chuckles)

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.199
(Peter) Sonny.

01:44:52.399 --> 01:44:53.399
Sonny.

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.438
Hey. You're not in Abu Dhabi?

01:44:56.439 --> 01:44:58.879
I fly out tonight. I, uh...

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.199
Yeah, I wanted to catch you.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:02.919
So, listen. (sighs)

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.720
We both know that the board's
wanted to unload Apex from the start,

01:45:07.359 --> 01:45:10.238
but, yeah, then you rode into town,

01:45:10.239 --> 01:45:12.799
raised our whole profile,
and now I've, uh...

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:15.239
Yeah, I've got... I've got buyers lining up.

01:45:17.119 --> 01:45:18.839
- Uh-huh.
- Gotta be honest with you, man,

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:21.720
I thought you were gonna be the...
the final nail in the coffin.

01:45:22.279 --> 01:45:23.799
But now I see the play.

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:27.359
And I want you as part of the package.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.039
What sort of package?

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.318
I've set up a sale where I run the team,

01:45:35.319 --> 01:45:36.920
and keep you on for strategy,

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.960
maybe even team principal.

01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:43.920
With the money from that deal,
I can make you a very rich man.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.238
Here's the thing.

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:48.358
With the... the changing regulations,

01:45:48.359 --> 01:45:51.680
new Mercedes power unit,
Kate's aero, two new drivers...

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.960
we've got a real shot
at the championship next year.

01:45:56.199 --> 01:45:57.358
What about Ruben?

01:45:57.359 --> 01:45:58.399
Don't worry.

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.358
You know.

01:46:00.359 --> 01:46:01.520
We won't embarrass him.

01:46:02.159 --> 01:46:04.920
We'll keep him on with a... with a title,
or brand ambassador...

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:06.560
You know, something.

01:46:10.479 --> 01:46:11.679
And I get final say?

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:12.919
Don't change a thing.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.119
Do what you do, man.

01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:16.520
And that's the irony here.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.318
You know, the board
originally approved your hire

01:46:19.319 --> 01:46:20.880
because we thought you'd help us lose.

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.000
- Sorry to make you sweat.
- Hey.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.719
That's my number.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.000
Talk to your people.

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:33.199
But, uh... (chuckles) ...right after the race,
I, uh... I wanna lock down the deal, okay?

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.560
- So, by Sunday?
- Perfect.

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.439
Listen, this thing can be your legacy,
you know?

01:46:41.479 --> 01:46:42.640
An F1 champion.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.199
What you always wanted, right?

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.959
It was you who forged those documents,
wasn't it?

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.000
Huh.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.319
(chuckles)

01:46:58.119 --> 01:47:00.840
- You're a killer, man, aren't you?
- Hey. I'm a winner.

01:47:02.399 --> 01:47:04.800
- Aren't you, huh?
- (sighs)

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:07.800
Okay.

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:12.920
Oh, hey. How's the back?

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:14.959
Better.

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.520
I've got an amazing guy.
I'll, uh... I'll hook you up.

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:19.720
Hail Mary.

01:47:46.199 --> 01:47:47.279
You good?

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.520
(sighs) Listen, Mum,
I've gotta tell you something.

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:04.079
In Monza, right before the crash,
it was my decision to make the move.

01:48:05.439 --> 01:48:07.119
Sonny actually told me to wait.

01:48:09.039 --> 01:48:12.039
(breathes deeply)

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:15.559
(knocks on door)

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:16.719
Family.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.118
I've been working the phones with IndyCar,

01:48:19.119 --> 01:48:20.919
and I think I can get you
a test drive, bruv.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.159
- Hello, Auntie. (kisses)
- Hi.

01:48:23.359 --> 01:48:25.719
They're trying to pull in
a new demographic, obviously.

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.399
And the ladies love that smile.

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.559
And we can throw in some incentives,
like flights and cars.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.600
Listen, Cash, you can go.
I don't need you today.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.078
Nah, mate. You got media next.

01:48:36.079 --> 01:48:38.640
(chuckles) I don't care. They can fine me.

01:48:39.399 --> 01:48:40.359
Besides,

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.359
that's not why I'm doing it, right?

01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:46.239
Josh, starting tomorrow,
we're not "doing it" anywhere.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.279
It's all just noise.

01:48:50.159 --> 01:48:52.239
Media, engagement, followers.

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.000
Listen, I've gotta focus on the race.

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.319
(Cash) Auntie, please.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.159
Well, you heard the man.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.279
- Deal.
- Deal. (chuckles)

01:49:16.159 --> 01:49:18.078
- Yo.
- Hey.

01:49:18.079 --> 01:49:19.600
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:49:22.439 --> 01:49:24.398
Guys, what's happening?

01:49:24.399 --> 01:49:27.519
Parc fermé.
Waiting for FIA to cut the seals.

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.600
Oh, good. (sighs)

01:49:30.119 --> 01:49:32.479
- We got time then.
- For what?

01:49:33.439 --> 01:49:34.560
For...

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.519
(chuckles)

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.680
No, no, no.

01:49:44.079 --> 01:49:47.238
Welcome to the Paddock Club,
for our most valued guests.

01:49:47.239 --> 01:49:51.078
Please, uh, grab a drink,
make yourselves at home,

01:49:51.079 --> 01:49:55.279
and, uh, enjoy the very best view
there is of, uh... of Formula 1.

01:49:57.239 --> 01:49:58.680
Okay? Okay.

01:50:02.239 --> 01:50:03.359
(clears throat)

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.800
Hey, guys, don't stop! Keep going!

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.640
(chuckles)

01:50:27.439 --> 01:50:30.159
(sighing)

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.560
(groans)

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:49.159
(stirring orchestral music playing)

01:50:52.039 --> 01:50:54.840
No way. (chuckles)

01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.640
(sighs)

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.800
Jesús, it's like a morgue around here.

01:51:07.039 --> 01:51:08.478
(stammers) How'd you get here?

01:51:08.479 --> 01:51:09.880
Premium economy.

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.199
(Ruben scoffs)

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.759
What? What is this?

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:17.358
Well, that's my bullshit loophole.

01:51:17.359 --> 01:51:19.478
Oh, no, forget it.
I'm not even going to read that.

01:51:19.479 --> 01:51:21.999
That is a real legal document
from a real Tijuana lawyer...

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.759
- (chuckles)
- ...waiving all liability to you

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.279
and your company vis-à-vis this race,
myself, and me.

01:51:27.319 --> 01:51:28.520
- And...
- (inhales sharply)

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.279
...since you owe me my last paycheck,
technically I'm still on this team.

01:51:39.319 --> 01:51:40.760
Kate, where's the shitbox?

01:51:41.399 --> 01:51:43.719
The FIA confirmed that
the documents were forged,

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.760
and they were sent by someone from Apex.

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.600
Huh.

01:51:48.199 --> 01:51:51.038
Okay, I don't care about your loophole.
I don't.

01:51:51.039 --> 01:51:53.078
That is my car. You are not racing it.

01:51:53.079 --> 01:51:54.238
- Ruben.
- No, Sonny.

01:51:54.239 --> 01:51:55.560
Listen,

01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.478
I can't let you do that.

01:51:58.479 --> 01:51:59.519
I can't.

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.679
Okay?

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.720
(stammers)

01:52:02.359 --> 01:52:05.840
If the last thing I do is drive that car,
I will take that life, man.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.920
A thousand times.

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.439
(sighs)

01:52:15.479 --> 01:52:16.680
We can't win.

01:52:18.439 --> 01:52:19.800
We can't if we don't try.

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:26.920
(sighs)

01:52:30.359 --> 01:52:31.520
(sighs)

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.439
(laughing)

01:52:42.039 --> 01:52:43.680
(laughs)

01:52:54.159 --> 01:52:56.359
(groaning)

01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.479
(knocks on door)

01:53:04.199 --> 01:53:05.639
How come you never look at the card?

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.839
(Sonny) What card?

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.880
(chuckles)

01:53:09.039 --> 01:53:11.399
(crowd cheering)

01:53:46.359 --> 01:53:48.679
Welcome to the very final spots
on the grid.

01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:52.959
And as ever, we'll go from last to first.
And breaking news here in P22,

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.559
because we're hearing
the Apex GP team have made...

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.279
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.038
That's your guy. Isn't it?

01:53:58.039 --> 01:54:01.959
...being replaced by Sonny Hayes, who
didn't even make the trip to Abu Dhabi...

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.478
Uh, will you excuse me for one second?
I'm really sorry.

01:54:04.479 --> 01:54:07.239
Now, the rules require that
he has to start at the back of the pack.

01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.079
Excuse me. What the hell?

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.960
What?

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:17.000
You still got my phone?

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:21.640
(phone buzzes)

01:54:35.199 --> 01:54:36.679
- Good luck today.
- You too, James.

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.839
Excuse me. Hey, Sonny. Sonny!

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.398
Hey, look,
I know we've had our differences,

01:54:39.399 --> 01:54:41.599
- but look, this is your last F1 race.
- Chaz! This guy.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.920
Any thought...

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:45.960
What's that?

01:54:47.199 --> 01:54:48.920
(crowd cheering)

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:51.199
Bloody hell.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.199
Bloody hell!

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.158
(laughs)

01:54:56.159 --> 01:54:58.560
(UAE national anthem playing)

01:55:14.039 --> 01:55:15.000
Elbows out?

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.600
Elbows out.

01:55:18.319 --> 01:55:23.639
(Croft) All set for our season finale
here in Abu Dhabi where it's lights out.

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:27.118
And away we go.
Good start there for Joshua Pearce.

01:55:27.119 --> 01:55:29.278
Drivers jockeying for position

01:55:29.279 --> 01:55:33.799
as we head full-throttle
down the main straight and into turn one.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:38.519
Tricky first corner, and going wide,
the Aston Martin and the AlphaTauri

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.679
- (laughs)
- as Pearce picks up two places.

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:43.038
(Brundle) Yes, Pearce showing
some real maturity there.

01:55:43.039 --> 01:55:47.039
He saw a bad situation before it happened
and he's off to a great start.

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.159
Don't even think about it.

01:56:21.479 --> 01:56:24.319
(Croft) Here comes the Alpine
down the inside. Contact!

01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:28.479
And three days out of hospital,
Hayes will feel that.

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.879
Gained places, guys. We're alive.

01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:41.479
(Brundle)
I hope he hasn't damaged the car,

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.318
but despite everything,
it's still a great first lap.

01:56:44.319 --> 01:56:46.318
(Croft) It is! Hayes in P16.

01:56:46.319 --> 01:56:48.840
Pearce, his teammate, up to P9.

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:53.919
Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari
holding on to the lead.

01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:55.639
Apex in the midfield.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.519
Let's see if they can do anything
to shake up this race.

01:56:58.520 --> 01:56:59.639
Gap to leader?

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:00.720
(Hugh) Fifteen seconds.

01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.319
Keep JP plus 20 seconds. Plus 20.

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:06.640
- Length of a pit stop.
- You know why.

01:57:08.079 --> 01:57:09.879
(Croft) It's a busy race for Sonny Hayes,

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.919
and now here comes Kevin Magnussen
looking to make a move.

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.639
And this could spell trouble.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.278
(Brundle)
There's history between these two.

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:19.559
Often, the irresistible force
meets the immovable object.

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:21.478
And Magnussen, looking down the inside,

01:57:21.479 --> 01:57:24.959
- locks up and hits Hayes.
- Box, box. Box, box, box.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:26.359
Copy, coming in for hards.

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.079
Damn.

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.600
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
Here we go, boys.

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.759
(Croft) Hayes exit the pits.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:44.519
He had to come in
because of that damage to his tire.

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.479
But what of Joshua Pearce?
Where do Apex GP go with him?

01:57:50.119 --> 01:57:51.959
(Joshua) Guys, am I boxing?
What's the plan?

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:54.358
Plan C, Plan C. Stay out. Stay out.

01:57:54.359 --> 01:57:56.999
- (laughs) Chaos.
- Copy that.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.399
Joshua slows down the leaders for Sonny.
Sonny does the same for him.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.278
(Brundle) Pearce stays out.

01:58:03.279 --> 01:58:06.238
It's a strategy that Apex have used
before this season.

01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:10.159
It helps them with track position for now,
but they gotta keep these tires alive.

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.159
It's the only way we keep this close.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.719
And then we need luck.

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:18.039
I'm way ahead of ya.

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.479
(Rico chuckles)

01:58:21.199 --> 01:58:24.599
(Croft) Lap 25, and every driver
so far has pitted, bar one.

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:26.398
And he leads the race.

01:58:26.399 --> 01:58:29.278
Joshua Pearce controlling the pace
out in front.

01:58:29.279 --> 01:58:30.999
(Brundle) And that gives
his teammate, Hayes,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.358
a chance to maintain
his position in the midfield

01:58:33.359 --> 01:58:36.519
despite the contact,
puncture and pit stop.

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.159
They're working really well together.

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:40.999
How's JP doing up there?

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.158
He's keeping the leaders at bay.
DRS active next straight, Sonny.

01:58:44.159 --> 01:58:45.479
Got it.

01:58:46.279 --> 01:58:49.679
(Croft) Onto the back straight.
He's enjoying this new upgrade,

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.799
and he's got DRS,
and he's got Pierre Gasly.

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.880
Sonny Hayes up into P15.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.239
(Hugh) Sonny, you have got the pace.
Keep pushing.

01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:00.679
(Brundle) Pearce has been doing
a great job out front

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:04.198
despite the used tires,
but that moment is nearly over now.

01:59:04.199 --> 01:59:06.999
Verstappen up the inside and he's through.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.478
(Croft) Fabulous first stint
from Joshua Pearce.

01:59:09.479 --> 01:59:11.840
Max has passed,
and his troubles don't end there.

01:59:13.119 --> 01:59:14.919
Here comes Charles Leclerc.

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:19.078
It's another overtake.
Pearce lost the lead and drops now to P3.

01:59:19.079 --> 01:59:21.519
Sorry, guys. My rear tires are shot.

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:23.319
Copy that. Box, JP. Box, box.

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:26.919
(Brundle) Pearce stretching those tires
to the limit.

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:29.800
Short-term pain for long-term gain.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:40.519
And he exits the pit.
He'll have fresher tires.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:43.600
He can now attack
in the second half of the race.

01:59:44.159 --> 01:59:45.919
Sonny, the three leaders
are still on hards.

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.839
They're gonna have to stop again.
This is their pit window.

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:50.800
One of the leaders is gonna undercut.
I need to be there when they do.

01:59:52.159 --> 01:59:54.359
P3 Ferrari. Pippa, can he beat it to one?

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:57.839
(Pippa) Depends on their stop.

01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:59.599
(Croft) Will the undercut
work for Ferrari?

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:01.880
Five point eight.
He needs to pick up half a second.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.278
Sonny, you need half a second.
Go, go, go, go, go.

02:00:06.279 --> 02:00:07.719
(Croft) And Sonny Hayes is on the charge.

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:10.118
Under the track goes the Ferrari.

02:00:10.119 --> 02:00:12.038
Through the first corner goes Sonny Hayes.

02:00:12.039 --> 02:00:14.679
It's neck and neck. It's really tight.

02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:18.118
Sonny Hayes is just ahead of Carlos Sainz.

02:00:18.119 --> 02:00:20.359
- Yes! Come on!
- (Croft) It's worked so far for Apex GP.

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:22.158
But their trouble's not over.

02:00:22.159 --> 02:00:26.278
Down the inside, there's a chance
for Carlos Sainz, and he takes it.

02:00:26.279 --> 02:00:27.519
But he locks up.

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.198
The Ferrari goes wide
and Sonny Hayes says,

02:00:30.199 --> 02:00:32.840
"Thank you very much indeed."

02:00:34.399 --> 02:00:36.398
How are they staying so close to the lead?

02:00:36.399 --> 02:00:39.520
Uh, they're, um... They're working together.

02:00:40.159 --> 02:00:43.520
(Brundle) Two Apex cars in the top 10,
but still a long way to go.

02:00:45.119 --> 02:00:48.799
(Croft) Twenty laps remaining, and Apex
has worked their way up the order.

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.079
We're now at the final pit stop window.

02:00:51.199 --> 02:00:53.639
This is our chance for P1.
Make sure JP beats them out.

02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:58.199
(Croft) Hamilton and Leclerc
come into the pits, but Pearce stays out.

02:00:59.199 --> 02:01:01.839
- (Joshua) Talk to me. Can I catch 'em?
- Yep. They're just coming out.

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.639
Push now. Push now. Push, push.

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.960
Copy. Pushing.

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.038
(Croft) Oh, this is gonna be close.

02:01:07.039 --> 02:01:09.959
Joshua Pearce inching ahead.
Staying ahead.

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:12.719
For the second time in this race,
he leads.

02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.759
(laughs) Let's go!

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:15.278
- (grunts)
- (grunts) Yes.

02:01:15.279 --> 02:01:18.238
You are P1, Joshua. (laughs)

02:01:18.239 --> 02:01:20.599
(Brundle) But Pearce will have
a hard time holding them off

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:23.479
with Hamilton and Leclerc on fresh tires.

02:01:32.319 --> 02:01:34.599
(Croft) Four laps to go.
Sonny Hayes is in P4.

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.519
He's five seconds behind his teammate,

02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.238
but both are on old tires.

02:01:38.239 --> 02:01:40.840
There's little chance
they'll gain any places now.

02:01:43.039 --> 02:01:46.799
And here's Hamilton
attacking Pearce into turn five.

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.078
And he's through.

02:01:48.079 --> 02:01:51.840
Nobody has to stop again
and our tires are nine laps older.

02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:55.959
(Brundle) And Leclerc attacks and passes.

02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.319
Pearce's tires are absolutely finished.
There was nothing he could do about that.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.959
I'm sorry, guys. I've got nothing left.

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.358
(Croft) It's been the Apex GP story
all year long.

02:02:07.359 --> 02:02:08.398
Plenty of risks.

02:02:08.399 --> 02:02:10.038
A great underdog story,

02:02:10.039 --> 02:02:12.038
but we know, Martin,
only talent crowns a champion.

02:02:12.039 --> 02:02:13.559
(Sonny) Losing grip. Tires are gone.

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.158
(Brundle) Yeah. Sadly, the deck's
been stacked against them

02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:18.038
and now they're out of cards to play.

02:02:18.039 --> 02:02:19.158
It ain't over, right?

02:02:19.159 --> 02:02:22.399
No, but nothing can change.
It's the worst feeling in the world.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:28.559
George Russell on the attack.

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:31.358
Hayes looking to defend,
through the left-hander they go...

02:02:31.359 --> 02:02:32.799
And there's contact!

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:35.519
Hayes is spun round and into the barrier.

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.238
That's a big one.

02:02:37.239 --> 02:02:38.279
(gasping)

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.119
- Fucking yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, no.

02:02:42.279 --> 02:02:43.238
Yeah, no. Ooh.

02:02:43.239 --> 02:02:44.919
(Brundle) There's debris
all over the race track

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.318
and substantial damage to the barriers.

02:02:47.319 --> 02:02:50.438
The stewards have no choice
but to red flag this race.

02:02:50.439 --> 02:02:51.478
Miracle.

02:02:51.479 --> 02:02:53.238
(Croft) And speaking of damage, Martin,

02:02:53.239 --> 02:02:55.759
Hayes will only be allowed
to continue in this race

02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.919
if he can get his car
all the way around the circuit

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.319
and back to the pit lane.

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:03.038
(Hugh) Sonny. Sonny, can you get it back?

02:03:03.039 --> 02:03:05.720
I'll get it back. I'll get it back
if I have to push it back.

02:03:06.279 --> 02:03:10.519
Come on, Sonny. Nice and easy.

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.999
(grunting)

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.679
He's still going.
(chuckling) He's still going.

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.118
(crew member) JP, red flag.

02:03:17.119 --> 02:03:18.358
Red flag. Come in.

02:03:18.359 --> 02:03:22.599
We are still alive, hermano. (laughs)

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.238
Red flag!

02:03:24.239 --> 02:03:27.799
(Brundle) And somehow Sonny Hayes
has got his car back to the pit lane.

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.959
- It's a miracle.
- I know! I know.

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:31.278
Never seen one until now.

02:03:31.279 --> 02:03:34.640
Home free. Good girl. Let's go.

02:03:35.319 --> 02:03:36.278
New softs, both cars.

02:03:36.279 --> 02:03:38.719
Raise the tire pressure
for three quick laps.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.799
- Team, time to build a car.
- (crew cheers, clamors)

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.198
(Croft) Red flag rules then.

02:03:42.199 --> 02:03:45.438
The teams can make changes.
They can make repairs to their cars.

02:03:45.439 --> 02:03:46.839
But only in that pit lane.

02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:51.680
And with only ten minutes to make repairs,
Apex GP has their work cut out.

02:03:52.119 --> 02:03:55.358
(Brundle) And all cars
can fit a fresh set of tires

02:03:55.359 --> 02:03:57.318
for what will be a three-lap sprint.

02:03:57.319 --> 02:04:00.199
- Dodge! Dodge, are we gonna make it?
- I don't know. I don't know.

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.278
That was clean.
That wasn't me. Not this time.

02:04:08.279 --> 02:04:11.919
"Not this time"?
Tell that to the stewards.

02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.199
Check the replay.

02:04:14.199 --> 02:04:16.039
I got this. Lift that corner.

02:04:24.079 --> 02:04:26.719
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good. I'm good.

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:28.278
(Brundle) What the stewards
will be looking at

02:04:28.279 --> 02:04:30.118
is whether Hayes went off completely

02:04:30.119 --> 02:04:33.999
or kept at least one tire on track
during the contact with Russell.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.719
- Yo, you good?
- Yeah, good.

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:36.959
Listen, you were on track.

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:39.959
Yeah, it was your corner.
P3 and P4. Let's go!

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:43.839
(Croft) Given Hayes's reputation, they'll
be looking at this really, really closely.

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.519
I'm not expecting a quick decision.

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:47.038
Come on, that's clearly a penalty.

02:04:47.039 --> 02:04:48.959
Like... I mean,
not that that's what we want,

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.519
but, like, objectively, that's the guy.

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:55.158
- Oh, man. It can't end this way.
- It's just a time-out.

02:04:55.159 --> 02:04:59.078
Like the last 30 years.
It's in the hands of the racing gods now.

02:04:59.079 --> 02:05:00.920
We gotta believe. Gotta believe.

02:05:02.359 --> 02:05:04.358
(Croft) Plenty going on here in the pit.

02:05:04.359 --> 02:05:07.478
Oh, look. Here comes the new wing.
This is a massive job.

02:05:07.479 --> 02:05:11.359
Yeah, but will the car hold together
for the remaining three laps?

02:05:14.439 --> 02:05:16.318
Well, that barrier looks okay now.

02:05:16.319 --> 02:05:19.639
The marshals just sweeping
the last few bits of debris off the track,

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.719
and the clock continues to tick down.

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.560
(Brundle) Yeah, it's just over two minutes
until this race gets underway again.

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:47.079
JP, JP!

02:05:48.319 --> 02:05:49.398
Three laps.

02:05:49.399 --> 02:05:50.839
Three laps is a lifetime.

02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:52.199
Go win this thing.

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:06.119
Hey, Sonny. Sonny, you got a minute?

02:06:08.239 --> 02:06:09.239
We got you a car.

02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:12.520
Ah, you rock. Thank you.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.158
(Brundle) Because Apex GP
didn't make the top 10 in qualifying,

02:06:18.159 --> 02:06:20.919
they have a new set
of soft tires available,

02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:24.158
which will give them extra speed
over the cars ahead of them

02:06:24.159 --> 02:06:26.398
on the used soft tires.

02:06:26.399 --> 02:06:29.238
This red flag is a lifeline.

02:06:29.239 --> 02:06:31.560
You'd almost wonder
if Sonny didn't engineer it.

02:06:32.359 --> 02:06:35.038
But wait, we're the only cars
on fresh tires

02:06:35.039 --> 02:06:36.799
because we sucked in qualifying yesterday?

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.478
Never got the chance to use them.

02:06:38.479 --> 02:06:40.719
Sometimes when you lose, you win.

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:43.199
- That don't make no sense.
- It's a Sonny thing.

02:06:44.039 --> 02:06:45.959
(Croft) Light at the end of the pit lane
is green.

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.078
We're off on our second formation lap
of the evening,

02:06:49.079 --> 02:06:52.599
and when this race resumes,
this is gonna be an epic sprint.

02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:55.560
Hamilton, Leclerc, Pearce, Hayes.
That's the top four.

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.679
(Hugh) Sonny, we just heard
from the stewards.

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:21.719
Goddamn it. Now?

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:23.358
(Hugh) We're debating whether to tell you.

02:07:23.359 --> 02:07:25.519
Kaspar says, "Yes,"
but Kate says, "Don't."

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.639
- She says you're fast when you're angry.
- (chuckles)

02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:29.639
- Tell her, "Job well done."
- (laughs)

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:32.639
(Croft) And here's news.
Stewards have made their decision.

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:37.839
That Lap 55 collision between Hayes
and Russell is ruled a racing incident.

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.999
- No further investigation.
- (cheering)

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.079
Whoa! Sonny.

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.039
That was your line, Sonny.
Go finish your race.

02:07:51.079 --> 02:07:53.679
Joshua, we still got two cars in the mix.

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:55.079
Then we've got a team.

02:07:56.199 --> 02:07:57.639
(Brundle) Once those red lights go out,

02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:00.520
this will be an absolute sprint
to the finish.

02:08:01.359 --> 02:08:03.759
Position advantage to Mercedes
and Ferrari.

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:06.119
Tire advantage to Apex GP.

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.118
Tell JP to follow my lead.

02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:34.919
(crew member)
Joshua, Sonny says to follow him.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.520
Follow? He's behind me.

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:41.199
- Cheeky bastard.
- (Sonny) That's it. Stay with me.

02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:51.318
(crew member) He's giving you a tow.
Take it.

02:08:51.319 --> 02:08:52.479
All the way.

02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.799
Come on, kid. Get it. Come on!

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:22.679
(Croft) Hayes plays the decoy,

02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:26.959
and Pearce rockets past Leclerc
and up into second.

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:32.278
And Leclerc's in danger from Sonny Hayes.
Round the outside, he's up into P3.

02:09:32.279 --> 02:09:33.679
(Brundle) Perfect teamwork.

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:37.319
Hayes and Pearce working together,
it's like racing ballet.

02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:39.438
(Croft) It's a beautiful sight,

02:09:39.439 --> 02:09:43.319
but now their sights are set on
the race leader, Lewis Hamilton.

02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:45.199
Yeah! Remember me?

02:09:54.399 --> 02:09:56.079
Come on, boys. Send it!

02:10:22.159 --> 02:10:23.318
Why didn't they overtake?

02:10:23.319 --> 02:10:24.919
Lewis will defend
whichever car attacks first.

02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.199
- But they both can't wait.
- Someone has to sacrifice.

02:10:33.279 --> 02:10:34.238
(Croft) Two onto one,

02:10:34.239 --> 02:10:36.799
and all the pressure is on Lewis Hamilton

02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:39.600
as Apex work as a pack.

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.559
Go win it, kid.

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.318
Hayes makes the first move.

02:10:43.319 --> 02:10:46.198
- Hamilton defends. Pearce attacks.
- Yeah!

02:10:46.199 --> 02:10:48.679
- And Pearce has P1.
- (crowd cheering)

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.000
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.839
(Croft) Toe-to-toe, wheel-to-wheel,

02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.358
this is epic racing
to finish off the season.

02:10:57.359 --> 02:10:59.999
And Sonny Hayes and Lewis Hamilton
aren't done yet.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.959
Hamilton, on Sonny Hayes.

02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:03.358
- There's contact!
- (crowd clamors)

02:11:03.359 --> 02:11:05.239
And through goes Hamilton.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.158
- Yes, yes!
- Come on!

02:11:10.159 --> 02:11:11.039
Yes!

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.198
Guys, talk to me.
Where's Sonny? Can he finish?

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:16.679
(crew member) One more lap, JP.
Hamilton never backs down.

02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:18.559
Can Sonny finish the race, man?

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:20.840
(crew member) Yes, he's on track.
Just watch Lewis when he fights.

02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:23.519
You're P1. No more risks.

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.640
No such thing.

02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:29.438
(Croft) The rookie holds his line.
He won't back down.

02:11:29.439 --> 02:11:32.960
He's here to fight
the seven-time world champion.

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:37.719
That made contact.

02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:41.799
The leader and Lewis Hamilton
are out of this race.

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:45.759
(Brundle) Despite yellow flags flying
at turn one, this race will continue.

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.119
(Hugh) Sonny, push, push, push.
You're P1! You're P1!

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:51.038
(Brundle) Apex GP has only one lap to go.

02:11:51.039 --> 02:11:54.079
The question is do they have the car?

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.920
We have the driver.

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:01.760
(muffled) Yeah! Go on, Sonny!

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:12.439
(breathing heavily)

02:12:45.079 --> 02:12:45.960
What's happening?

02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:47.960
He's flying.

02:13:12.079 --> 02:13:13.919
(Hugh) Sonny, you did it! We won! We won!

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:14.959
(crew cheering)

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.560
Yeah!

02:13:21.159 --> 02:13:22.800
Yes!

02:13:27.359 --> 02:13:28.318
Yeah!

02:13:28.319 --> 02:13:30.039
(cheers)

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:33.799
We won!

02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.640
- Yeah!
- (cheering continues)

02:13:39.439 --> 02:13:40.439
Yeah!

02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:43.159
We won!

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.800
- We did it! Whoo!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:13:50.079 --> 02:13:52.680
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

02:13:56.840 --> 02:13:59.199
- Come on! Yes!
- Yes!

02:14:10.039 --> 02:14:12.279
Means another three years
for Ruben, right?

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.880
Yeah.

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.439
I guess we'll check back about that deal.

02:14:20.279 --> 02:14:22.079
Presuming you're still on the board.

02:14:31.039 --> 02:14:34.639
(Croft) Breathtaking!
Breathless! Incredible!

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.398
What an Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
this has been!

02:14:37.399 --> 02:14:39.398
What a victory as well!

02:14:39.399 --> 02:14:43.639
(Brundle) Absolutely. It's a race
for the ages. An absolute thriller.

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.078
- And this man wins his first Grand Prix.
- Well done.

02:14:47.079 --> 02:14:48.799
- It's been 30 years in the making.
- Well done!

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:52.038
And the team did a brilliant job
from the pit wall.

02:14:52.039 --> 02:14:55.398
- And of course we can't forget Pearce...
- Oi! What you smiling about?

02:14:55.399 --> 02:14:57.759
- ...playing his part in this victory.
- (Sonny) You.

02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:00.118
I'm gonna win a million races.
You should at least have one.

02:15:00.119 --> 02:15:01.840
(Sonny laughing)

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:03.880
We did it.

02:15:04.479 --> 02:15:05.800
(Sonny) Yeah, we did.

02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.519
(exclaims)

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:11.560
Whoo!

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:15.479
(sighs)

02:15:19.039 --> 02:15:20.078
(spectator) Sonny!

02:15:20.079 --> 02:15:21.520
No, no, no, no. Give it to him.

02:15:22.359 --> 02:15:23.840
No, no, no. Give it to him.

02:15:26.399 --> 02:15:28.640
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.

02:15:33.199 --> 02:15:36.479
(cheering)

02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.520
Let's go!

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:44.519
(mutters)

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.159
(kisses) I love you.

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:55.599
Yeah!

02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:57.679
Today we get to say...

02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:59.960
- "We are the best in the world!"
- "We are the best in the world!"

02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:02.960
(cheering)

02:16:22.239 --> 02:16:23.680
(cheering continues)

02:16:31.039 --> 02:16:32.959
(dramatic music playing)

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:39.600
(breathing heavily)

02:16:49.879 --> 02:16:53.399
(breathing heavily)

02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:07.638
(cheering)

02:17:07.639 --> 02:17:08.679
Joshua.

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:11.119
If you were ever to consider
to drive somewhere else,

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.158
you know where to find me.

02:17:12.159 --> 02:17:15.719
Thanks, Toto, but I'm happy where I am.

02:17:16.399 --> 02:17:17.600
Congratulations.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.958
Yeah, baby! Let them wait!

02:17:21.959 --> 02:17:23.759
- Let them wait!
- (laughs)

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:25.360
- (exclaims)
- (screams)

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.398
(Ruben) The cup!

02:17:28.399 --> 02:17:31.158
Kate, you built a hell of a car.

02:17:31.159 --> 02:17:32.600
(chuckles)

02:17:34.879 --> 02:17:37.760
- (crowd exclaiming, chattering)
- (breathing heavily)

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:53.000
(sighs)

02:18:11.239 --> 02:18:14.280
(panting)

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:23.719
(chuckles)

02:18:24.399 --> 02:18:25.440
(chuckles)

02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:33.959
(Kate) Another race I don't know about?

02:18:35.639 --> 02:18:36.600
Somewhere.

02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:39.799
That beats this? (chuckles)

02:18:43.319 --> 02:18:44.280
Yeah.

02:18:47.639 --> 02:18:50.439
I wanted to say, "See you down the road,"

02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:52.920
but in a way that was more poetic.

02:18:55.639 --> 02:18:56.600
So...

02:18:58.879 --> 02:19:00.360
Can I see you down the road?

02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:06.719
Yes.

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:09.959
(chuckles)

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:23.840
Hang on to that until then.

02:19:25.879 --> 02:19:27.639
Okay. (chuckles)

02:19:30.879 --> 02:19:32.199
And drive fast.

02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:33.840
(Sonny chuckles)

02:19:41.799 --> 02:19:43.399
(Joshua) And where do you
think you're going?

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:46.679
(chuckles) Don't worry about me.
Go celebrate.

02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:48.200
But you're off to where?

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.200
You know, couple more dragons to slay.

02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:53.040
It's your team now.

02:19:55.719 --> 02:19:57.078
It was always my team.

02:19:57.079 --> 02:20:00.238
(both chuckle)

02:20:00.239 --> 02:20:01.440
I'll be watching.

02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:04.159
See you around, swan.

02:20:06.079 --> 02:20:08.759
(laughs)

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:10.760
(dramatic music playing)

02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:13.000
(sighs)

02:20:45.559 --> 02:20:46.520
(music stops)

02:20:50.159 --> 02:20:52.319
("Hablando de Mí" playing on radio)

02:21:02.159 --> 02:21:04.120
(engine revving)

02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:17.719
Hello!

02:21:18.959 --> 02:21:20.000
(in Spanish) Buenas.

02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:25.159
I'm told you're looking for a driver.

02:21:26.399 --> 02:21:27.719
What's your name?

02:21:28.639 --> 02:21:29.840
Sonny Hayes.

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:35.719
Have you ever driven Baja?

02:21:36.799 --> 02:21:37.760
Nope.

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:39.680
We can't pay much.

02:21:40.239 --> 02:21:41.479
Not about the money.

02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:47.360
So what is it about?

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.759
(chuckles)

02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:52.519
(rock music playing)

02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:55.119
Hey

02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:57.120
(engine revving)

02:22:00.079 --> 02:22:01.479
Hey

02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:08.679
Flying through the city
With the speakers up loud

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:11.159
Speeding by with the top down

02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:14.318
Fast lane living
Till they put me in the ground

02:22:14.319 --> 02:22:16.360
And I don't wanna stop now

02:22:17.079 --> 02:22:19.638
Pull away, wind blowing
Now I'm cruising

02:22:19.639 --> 02:22:22.759
Put the past in the past
A new day is coming

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:25.558
Ha-la-lay-la, we can ride

02:22:25.559 --> 02:22:28.439
Four wheels, you and I
Gotta get out of here

02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:32.239
Ha-la-lay-la, my savior

02:22:33.959 --> 02:22:36.878
Ha-la-lay-la, we can fly

02:22:36.879 --> 02:22:39.599
Out of this burning fire
Just take me anywhere

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:43.279
Ha-la-lay-la, my savior

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:45.520
Pedal down and drive

02:22:47.159 --> 02:22:48.440
Drive

02:22:48.959 --> 02:22:50.599
Pedal down and

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:53.920
Drive

02:22:55.559 --> 02:22:59.159
Just drive

02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.238
Out of the city
Now we're switching four lanes

02:23:04.239 --> 02:23:06.440
Got our eyes on a fresh start

02:23:07.159 --> 02:23:09.798
The world as we knew it
That was caught up in flames

02:23:09.799 --> 02:23:11.879
Get ready for the next part

02:23:12.399 --> 02:23:15.199
You know I'm good
If I'm back in the gutter

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:18.318
'Cause this life
It was never about the money

02:23:18.319 --> 02:23:21.119
Ha-la-lay-la, we can ride

02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:23.999
Four wheels, you and I
Gotta get out of here

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.639
Ha-la-lay-la, my savior

02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:32.158
Ha-la-lay-la, we can fly

02:23:32.159 --> 02:23:35.039
Out of this burning fire
Just take me anywhere

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:38.839
Ha-la-lay-la, my savior

02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:40.760
Pedal down and drive

02:23:42.639 --> 02:23:44.078
Drive

02:23:44.079 --> 02:23:46.239
Pedal down and drive

02:23:48.239 --> 02:23:49.280
Drive

02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:51.599
Pedal down and

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:55.000
Drive

02:23:56.639 --> 02:24:00.280
Just drive

02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:02.638
Pedal down and

02:24:02.639 --> 02:24:06.000
Drive

02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:11.319
Just drive

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.039
Pedal down and drive

02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:15.719
(song ends)
